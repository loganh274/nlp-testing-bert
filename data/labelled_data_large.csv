"Is there an update on this please?",2
"Yes, update please. This function is a must for those of us who have customers/clients who are required to pay multiple invoices at once. Can we please get this function added ASAP.",2
any news on this option to add Pay Now link to the statements please ?,2
"I can't believe I've just stumbled across this as a feature that doesn't already exist. 

In my view it's very primative that with xero you can't add a link to 'pay now' when sending statement e-mails. It is 2025.. this should be already available... come on xero developers, please get this enacted. There's businesses like ours setting up direct debits for customers, growing sending an ever increasing number of invoices, team Xero should be treating this as a priority. 

Competitiors already do this?! Although I suppose if it's left long enough, enough folk will start looking elsewhere for accountancy programmes and there won't be a need for this anymore!",1
"This is a really basic omission which, having just switched to Xero, I'm really frustrated about.  I hope it gets added very soon.",1
This has been ongoing for some time. What sort of timescale are we talking Xero.,1
It doesn’t make sense that there isn’t yet available. Please fast track.,1
This feature would help immensely with cash flow,2
This is a must release feature in my opinion,2
We are a school using Xero we invoice annually and parents can pay monthly so it is really necessary for the online payment method to be linked to statements as well. Doesn't make sense that this is still unavailable.,2
"I have discovered that there is now a ""Review and Pay"" button on statements.

It will only appear if the invoice is new. I have found that you can prompt it to show in older statements by ""editing"" an invoice. You don't need to edit anything, you just need to make Xero think you have edited the invoice.",2
"Hi, some of our customers does not want review and pay button in customer statement email. Is there any way we can remove the link?",2
YES! FINALLY!!!! I have been using my own custom made template for this for ages - seems crazy to send a client a statement with 10+ outstanding invoices on it and expect them to open each invoice and click the links separately...! this pay now feature is well overdue. thank you Xero! I am v sad I didn't get to try it out though... hopefully in the next pool??!,4
Not having the actual invoice attached to the draft bill generated when sending using the network key makes this function useless.  HMRC are undertaking more enquiries and you need to have the supporting documentation at your fingertips should a question arise,1
Looking forward for this feature.,2
"I also do need zero balances included. Any progress on this?? 

I agree with other users that this is a basic function that should be readily available. It seems clients have been waiting for this to happen for ever. I only use Xero because my employer already was using this software... but thinking of transitioning to better one as it seems basic features aren't yet setup in this platform..",1
Seems that this really is a priority for many Xero users now. Any update?,2
"Hi Team, this feature would make every user of Xero's life a bit easier! Any update on this?",2
"@Xero - any update? This is more important than trying to push us onto a New Invoicing that no one wants. 

Please, listen to your people rather than looking for new customers with 90% off sales",2
"This should be straightforward for a professional development team, especially since you already have the same function active on another page.",1
"This should be a no brainer!!!!

This would save your users a lot of time and frustration. Makes me want to go back to MYOB",0
"This is a basic requirement for quoting software. 

How many comments on this thread does it need.....",1
"I'm struggling to understand how this has been a suggestion for 10 years and still not been done. I'm starting to doubt my decision to move to Xero, the product development seems to be stagnant, with no interest in customer requests.",1
Xero has an AI-powered CoPilot assistant ... but I still can't copy a link to a quote.,1
Please can we have this. It seems relatively straight forward as you have the system to create the link anyway for the email.....,2
It's hard for me to understand why this is still not implemented. Does Xero even care about what its users need?,1
3 years on from it's original submission and still not a feature which is a great shame. Is there are progress on this please?,1
"Please add the suggested functionality, would greatly increase usability of XERO",2
When can I get the Online Quote Link from the API?,2
"I just came from QuickBooks and they had this feature and I was sure that Xero would have this feature. This would be so easy to achieve surely just a button near the send button that would say share link? Considering the system already creates a link, its almost there!!",1
"@kellymunro

This is such a needed feature  - do we have any updates yet please?...",2
😭 why hasn't this been added yet,1
its not that hard to do ... it must be a strategic choice to not make this link available,1
"As per everyone else on the planet, it's ludicrous that this isn't yet a feature. Please implement ASAP.",1
Xero will waste time with ai and dashboard updates that no one asked for but basic features that all other and cheaper platforms have xero lacks.,1
"Yes! At the moment we can filter by staff member but they're not even in date order.  Filter by date, filter by supplier within each staff member would be common sense.  We have a huge list linked to multiple credit cards and it's so hard to find particular ones.",2
"The rest of Xero has excellent sort, filter and search options, but these don't exist in Expenses. It is therefore extremely hard to find or navigate submitted expenses using the current layout and functions. Please can you give us an update as to when this functionality will be made available.",3
Please do this - it can't be difficult!,1
"Hi Xero,

Any update on this? would be highly appreciated if this can get sorted out asap. we produce loads of items and every month there are cost prices which need to be adjusted. now we have to adj the stock on hand cost price per item. which is very time consuming.",2
"Hello,

Coming up 8 months since the last update on where this is headed. I understand a large amount of businesses wouldn't need this feature but for the ones that do, its entirely necessary to run. Even just being able to delete all current items recorded in stock then reuploading a new list of items would be a tremendous amount faster.

Is there any update on this?

Thank you,
Mike",2
"I keep getting emails from Xero about how to improve their inventory. The Inventory ""system"" in Xero is almost infantile. This is a prime example. It is unbelievable in 2025 that bulk inventory adjustments remain unavailable, particularly when users have been complaining (by this thread) for 3 years. It is not rocket science. Xero might as well say they do not have an inventory system as it is missing so many basic features as to be virtually unusable.",1
"I am right in saying that you can do bulk Ventory importation of cost price and sales price, but not bulk stock quantity?

What is difference??

In the meantime we are forced to upload 2600 items manually, which is TIME consuming.",1
"Hello Kelly,

As stocktake time nears, I am wondering how progress on this vital issue is going. I do not wish to waste the time required to go into every item and my bosses do not wish to pay overtime for this to happen either. Please help!",1
"After having multiple Xero support hook ups about this issue it seems I was not alone. Not sure why Xero went through days of support just to send me to this thread. Whilst support were determined to help it seems they were none the wiser to this issue either?

If it is a known lack of ability in the system then I would suggest Xero specifically mentions this in the product pages so we don't go around in circles trying to work out what as users we might be doing wrong. Once Xero developers complete this vital function to bulk upload and adjust all inventory features, then tell us it is possible. 

I also note it has been almost a year since the announcement it is being worked on. Come on Xero. You're a global company. Chop chop.",1
"I'm moving to Xero from MYOB. I've exported my items from MYOB but don't understand why I can't just setup the column with the qty to be able to import them into Xero. It would make the transition so much easier but now I have to perform additional steps to do this or do I have to manually go into each item to update it?
I thought this would have been such a simple thing to do. MYOB enables quite a number of fields to be imported.
Also, why does it only allow CSV or TXT files and not spreadsheets to be imported? CSV files don't always format correctly so it requires more work to ensure they are correct.",1
What would be handy is daily automatic stock updates from Square Retail to Xero. The same as how your daily sales are sent to Xero but include current stock quantities as well.,2
"Fantastic to see this has now been released onto at least one of my clients!!!

One thing I have noticed however and gives room for further improvement is that not all clients run stock adjustments through a single account code. 

It would be great to have the ability to identify the account code for the adjustment in the table with the product items and not just in the header of the form.

Regardless this is a great step forward and a timesaver.",4
This function isnt working. Do you have any issues with it ?,1
"Bills - Ability to auto fill accounting code and tracking category when there are multiple lines. At present if you are entering a bill with say 10 lines, you have to click into each line, select the GL code and tracking category and this takes lots of time. We need the lines split out for job purposes to see quantities etc so cant just enter as one bulk line. Sometimes 9 lines might be one code and 1 line another so its important to not only be able to auto fill but to then be able to edit or change the odd line also.",2
"This is going to become a far bigger issue with the expansion of STP2 - anything that can be done to mitigate payroll errors is highly valuable.  While payroll reporting is one of the issues compromised if an ABN changes in a file, there are other issues that can occur as well.  Best practice drives a single ABN to a single Xero file.  Trying to manipulate a Xero file across 2 ABNs is fraught, and false economy",1
100% and so important with STP Phase 2 coming!,2
"I believe this is critical. There have been so many questions about needing to start a new file for a new entity. This will lock it in. With the new STP2 requirements it would be a nightmare to fix when a client does the wrong thing. 
I don’t believe it would be difficult to program.",1
Love this! So many small businesses come to me after having done this and it is a mess!,4
"Having had the experience of trying to fix and relodge STP finalisation for a client who went ahead and changed ABN and then continued filing payroll under new ABN, this is very important. It was a very painful and fiddly process to fix this in the small window between payruns. I hope never to do this again, no matter how much the client pays me.",1
"BUT, it would help if we could CLONE the current setup of a file into a new File.",2
This is a critical change to ensure that clients do not use the same file for different entities.,2
Lock abn and company type.,2
"Each ABN is a separate legal entity so can only belong to one Xero file. 
Both the ABN and legal entity type (eg sole trader, partnership, company) belong exclusively to each other and should be represented by separate Xero files and once set up not be allowed to change to prevent client disaster.",2
"Lock ABN & Company type. New ABN, new file. It’s a headache for Bookkeepers & Accountants.",2
Lock ABN and Company Type,2
For data keeping accuracy this is critical,2
"It would also help for reporting purposed; especially to Govt departments; if the ABN printed on Payroll Activity reports etc.

Actually it wouldn't hurt for it to print as part of all Xero reports by default.
As part of the report header information.",2
"This would be useful as it is difficult to find recent expenses, whether to check details or even that you have not already submitted.  

In some ways it seems crazy that Xero currently displays your submitted expenses in a random order.  Can't understand why it does not display in date order by default.",2
"I am new to this discussion, 3 years on and still not fixed. Very poor.",1
We also need this functionality.,2
"@Kelly. Great news. Question - will multiple 'client' email addresses flow through to tax payments module to issue tax payment letters for multiple recipients (i.e. the same way that the main email does now, just with more addresses)? That was one of the key reasons for multiple email addresses applicable to all NZ practices anyhow.",3
"Hi,

Would it be possible to look at allocating email addresses to default templates. For example:

Sales
Email 1 → Sales Invoices/Credit Notes/Quotes
Email 2 → Statements
Email 3 → Accounts

Purchases
Email 4 → Purchase Orders/Sales
Email 5 → Account
Email 6 → Remittances",2
"It is very frustrating to not be able to work with custom date ranges and have total columns that can produce percentages. We reopened our business part way through our financial year after a development, have multiple departments that we track, but can't do a report that covers, as an example, Aug-Feb crossing 2 financial years and get the total to date figures that you can get for YTD. It is a simple functionality that is absolutely needed.",1
"GoCardless is probably one of the worst payment gateways. They’ve just decided to deactivate our account with no prior warning and refused to give us a valid reason. You can imagine the time it will take to resetup all the clients which are currently on direct debit with gocardless.

Upon reading some reviews, it seems a lot of organisations are also facing this same issue. GoCardless apparently deactivated user accounts without warning and without reason. It’s plastered all over the internet with 1 star reviews. Why is Xero even in partnership with a payment gateway with such horrid customer service?

Please implement direct debit payments through Stripe.",1
Also the possibility to activate a bank 2-Steps-Verification process or bank onetime pin when using stripe integration,2
I'm just here to remind Stripe that their paying customers are asking for improvements to the platform that should be attended to. This is on of those improvements,2
"Xero, could we move this up the list of urgency as per the comments below please? It's very important that this feature is available for other entities and not just individuals. We shouldn't have to resort to other SBR tax providers....",2
Trust returns are important for those Deceased Estates that need to be wound up prior to the end of each Tax Year.,2
Deceased estates need to be prepared in advance so TRT feature would be most helpful,2
"Hi Xero team,

It feels like forever since you announced plans to develop Company Tax Returns (CTR) for the future. Could you provide an update on the progress? It's time to prepare early balance CTR again now.

Looking forward to your response!",2
"Hi Xero Team, 
Not long to go now before the 12 month anniversary of your post made on the 30th April 2024, which advised that you were working on the future returns function for company returns over the next 12 months. Where are we at?",1
We gave up waiting we use LodgeIT for future returns now.,1
Can I have feedback on user experience on LodgeIT - we are also considering using it,0
"Hi Kelly,
This future year CTR doesn't allow to pull the figures from Xero (blue files). Will this be the second phase of the development?

Thanks,",2
I literally completed a 2025 paper Trust return yesterday for a deceased estate that is being wound up...,2
"Good that future company returns can be done, but surely it isnt that hard to build one for trusts and partnerships too?",3
Any update?,2
"Any update on TTR's? As mentioned below several times, it would be very handy for winding up deceased estates.",2
"I had to complete a manual tax return for a simple estate, which via the ATO mandate, should have been processed in 28 days.  It took 3 months due to the return being a paper return. The ability to prepare a future return will just speed up the whole process.",2
Thank you :) This will make the finalisation of deceased estates and vesting of trusts so much easier.,3
Add the company account number to the list of fields that could be inserted into an invoice email. In the absence of the invoice export including the invoice url (something that would enable us to give our customers access to their invoice from within our SaaS platform) we could scrape the company number and invoice url from the emails generated and that would give us a decent work around.,2
Xero should allow for a contact export where you can have a column with the unique ID of each contact. That is quite helpful if you need to run a reconciliation with other systems.,2
"We are at risk of breaching a clients confidentiality as we aren't able to restrict clients files, timesheets, invoices only Tax and Xero Files. Would love to also be able to chose which person can't rather than all the ones that can (have both options) and also to restrict a whole Client Group as well as just each individual/entity",2
Does anyone have ideas on a work around for this? Or how they currently approach with the limitations? Ideally staff would only have access to and see the clients they are working on or a subset of the full client list. Seems crazy that this functionality is not available.,1
"It is imperative that we can hide partner and other staff income from other employees, it can create unnecessary friction when staff can see what the earnings are of others within the organisation. I am very suprised this hasn't been a top priority for Xero. Certain clients should only be accessible by certain staff.",1
Still nothing on this? Seems crazy that this hasn't been remedied. Seems like a basic function for a product that deals with sensitive information.,1
Great idea!,3
"With the updates to STP reporting, many clients are being found non-compliant on super payments.  To be able to easily reconcile payments made in Xero Super, it would be very useful to generate an Excel file of what was paid - how much, to whose fund, and what payroll period it belongs to.",2
"Hey Marianne I have just come across this issue and found a quick resolution. You can highlight the text above the table, where it says ""Total"" and Status"". You can then drag down to the bottom of the table of data, copy and paste into a spreadsheet and there you have it.

It took me grabbing one of our software developers and me showing him the issue for me to then just highlight above it and get the resolution myself!",3
This should be made possible .,2
"Hi there, it already 2025 and the future are still not available. Please do something about it. We have a lot of client with different currency.",1
"In addition to needing an employee detail report (a basic payroll requirement, I don't understand why it is still not available) you used to be able to see the employee leaving date on the employee history tab. This column has now been removed and replaced with the same column as on the current employee tab - next pay run date - which is totally unnecessary for former employees!

A backward step Xero",1
With a large payroll It is important that the reports can carry any information that has been entered in the set up e.g current position held . To allow analytical assessments to be made,2
"I can not believe there is not a report that you can run of employees with salary and start date . A very basic payroll report !!!!!!

I agree with this statement - great for checking when you have a payrise",1
"There's currently no payroll report that shows the employee numbers as well as employee names in Xero.

Please could we have it added to the payroll details and summary report, before we post the pay run, as when a few employees have similar names, it is easier to identify and investigate any anomalies and who they relate to, via the number not the name.",2
this is a critical report for payroll can you add this please?,1
Another user requesting - it seems a very basic function that would be very useful to us.,1
"Hi Kelly, it would very helpful if we could update the report codes directly on the chart of accounts page as well",2
"Absolutely need to edit the report code mapping directly from COA. This makes zero sense to have to add the code in one place, then navigate several pages away to then edit the mapping. Especially as Xero practice reports are reliant on accurate report code mapping.",2
I also need to be able to assign tracking categories to employees and the option to split the total between several tracking categories,2
Mindblowing that such a simple standard function is not available,1
"Wow, I thought I just hadn't figured out how to use expenses properly yet, but sounds like everyone has the same problems as I do. Its so time consuming trying to sort through old expenses. Impossible to tell if there's duplicates. Can't search or sort. I'm in disbelief that this is just how it is. Get your act together Xero!",1
"At the least, allow the data to be downloaded in csv...",2
"Adding another voice - incredible I can't easily sort by expense date, whether approved, draft etc, or by where spent. Such a critical thing to have to check for potential duplicates etc. Please fix!",1
It is ridiculous that employees cannot update this information in Xero Me.  Please fix this ASAP. Thanks,1
"Is there a good reason why employees can edit their personal details on Xero Me, but not their residential address? This doesn't make sense at all.",1
Please add this to the UK payroll!,2
just want confirmation that they have been sent,2
Staff Access to Xero Clients- I have more than 200 clients. I am struggling assigning the clients to my Team using new method especially when new team member join and i need to allocate 50 clients to him. Is it possible to allow old methods as an option who want to use that. It was more helpfull as I could  assign multiple clients at same  window instead of one by one in this new way. Also In new way client are in random order and there is no way sorting them in assending or desending order.,2
"In My Xero staff I could quickly review all clients and see which staff had which level of access and could update multiple client access for a staff member in seconds.

Now I have to click into each client , click staff and then change each staff member's access. A ten second job could now take hours!! 

It is essential Xero HQ staff has the same functionality or switch My Xero staff BACK ON!",1
Just short of 1200 clients and 208 staff. I really would like to be able to bulk edit the staff to client permissions.,2
"We used to be able to add staff to certain groups and that option has been taken away, which seems crazy",1
Has this been fixed?,2
Xero should be set to identify when someone is below the minimum wage,2
Very frustrating as he isn't a new director but I am taking over the payroll from someone else that has been running it this tax year. So far this year he was on the alternative system but xero won't let me continue this,1
very important,2
"This has been needed for years.
Freshbooks has allowed this for forever.",2
"I am getting an error when I copy a paid bill, it creates the new bill as a draft.  Sometimes it retains the previous bills total value and other times it doesn't. 
I override the quantity value and then save.... but the entry log retains the previous bills total value and the total value at the top reverts back to the previous paid bills value not the new entered value. This is random.",2
I was looking for this functionality for my payroll reporting as well. I would love to see it added to the Payroll Employee Summary report.,2
All the other accounting software allow you to 'fix' the reconciliation and will alert you if any changes are made that affect the bank balance. This is the main feature I find lacking in Xero.  Considering how often aswell there are times when the banks don't sync properly and therefore the balances don't match the actual paper statement I would like to do it and record it within Xero on a more regular basis,2
"Thanks for adding this feature. I'm trying it and I noticed that if you copy and paste a value with a $ in it, it will not paste properly. Sometimes when you copy paste opening or closing balances from PDF it copies including the dollar sign.

Please allow to paste the value with the $ in it.

Also, there doesnt seem to be any way of deleting a draft period. Please consider adding a small garbage bin icon in the period list and inside the period.

Thanks!",3
Will there be an option to attach the bank statement as a reference?  That would be helpful - you can attach files to all other transactions... this should be no different.,2
"No, we require the ability to lock the VAT period but have the accounting period open. This will allow the VAT period to remain unchanged but facilitate adjustment to the accounting period. Client that give invoices out of the VAT period create huge reconciliation problems, at the moment.",2
Critical need for us too - Date and period should be separate fields/options in the system - it's the only way to enable accurate reporting.,2
Please add this Xero as it would make all those you are converting over easier.  Given there are a number of items where Xero is short compared to Sage Handitax it would be good to have some of these resolved.  Thank you.,2
"Please add this to Xero, this would make it easier to estimate future instalments for the client.",2
I would really appreciate this NOT being the default as we don't like it included as it very often gives inaccurate estimates that we don't want to show the client. You should just be able to switch it on if you need it not the other way around.,1
"Omg Xero, why don't you understand requests properly???! 😂

Previously:
You want the option to print PAYGI? Too bad, you didn't change it on the estimates page from No to Yes. So you can't print it unless you unlock the return.

Xero:
We've not only given you the option to print PAYG Instalments - we're forcing you to 🙄

Leave it available in the print settings but default it to No! We don't want to print it every time, we just want to be able to print it sometimes and not need to unlock the return to do so! Seriously...

Why does Xero make changes that affect everyone on requests with only 38 votes..?",1
this is highly needed,2
Great to hear this will be released soon.,3
"Pleased to see some bulk changes can now be made on the Job Manager table, hopefully the ability to change the job status this way is not far off as it would be so useful for us.",2
"Oh yes those zeroes are such a time waster. In June 2025!
Even the prefill report from the ATO doesn't show Nil amounts, why does Xero create them?",1
"In the process of moving from Sage to Xero and am ""surprised"" that Xero doesn't do reports including nil balances.  When I say surprised, actually gobsmacked.  Its a pretty fundamental function",1
"This is SO BASIC it is infuriating that it is not there.

It is INTERESTING to note that there is a Report that is meant to show this; however, it is not.  I have raised a case with XERO; however, true to form, they can only double-talk me.  The case is CX0015946553 and the report is ""Trail Balance - all accounts incl NIL transactions"" is not showing the Nil Transactions 

XERO just seem to treat users with content - even when a report they have created is not working.

Come on, XERO, at least fix the reports that are there that are not working!",0
This would be really helpful to have all account codes on there.  Also on the P&L it would be great to have a choice as to whether accounts with no balance on are included or not.,2
"Kelly, it is such a basic feature! We must have Balance Sheet, Trial Balance and P&L with zero balance account shown. So, we can do mapping in Excel and many other reporting functions.

Also, could you please tell me why the budget report (it seems the only report that shows zero balance ledger accounts) has a different format for the ledger account name and number? Why is the account number located after the account name and in brackets??? It makes more harder for us to do mapping between the budget and P&L.",1
"When will this upgrade be available please? It is a pretty simpe upgrade.

Xero should add a check box that allows hiding of zero balance items.

The DEFAULT should be 'Export Everything' with the option to excude zero balance items.

I have 5 companies in different countries and all have the exact same GL with the idea that we can export an excel and simply consolidate across. Right now, it is a huge work to manually re allign alll the rows so I need to export ALL so that they will automatically match in EXCEL.",1
"I completely agree. We export our products to international markets, including the USA, and are expected to conform to their local requirements. Being able to correctly display customer's addresses on invoices, for example, is a fairly basic but nonetheless important function.",2
No brainer of a report,1
"This is even more important now that the leave dated has been dropped from the employee history screen since an upgrade.

I have ended up cobbling information together from an external source to identify leaver dates in the year for 20 out of 50 employees when preparing P11Ds this year which is just bonkers!",1
Auditors frequently ask for this information.,2
This report will save my time every month - it would really make my life easier.,2
"Why does XERO autofill the ""payment date"" to some weird date? Eg: I'm paying wages today (4 June 2024) and Xero autofills the payment date to 18 May 2024. If I didn't pick on this then IRD would fine us $250 for late filing and payment (trust me I've been burnt twice on this very issue). Xero should not autofill the payment date but leave it blank for us to fill in.",1
"We often run Unscheduled payrolls for late Timesheet hours, sometimes days or weeks later. Would like the payment date to default to Today - as seems pointless it defaulting to a date past when filing is no longer possible and only causes the headache of late filing penalties!",1

New Invoicing -Option to Add Multiple New Lines at once (5, 10, 15 or 20)

When using Classic version of invoicing, there was an option to Add a new line and then a drop down option to Add 5, Add 10, Add 20 lines.

In the New version of invoicing, this option seems to have disappeared?

Please provide this option if this has not already been provided. I can only seem to add a new line after entering the first line of information.

I found the Add 5 and Add 10 lines really helpful when I'm copying similar job items down a list than having to tab across to get to the next line when I was preparing sales invoices.

This has to be a priority as we're unable to raise invoices unless we are able to add several lines - this is crucial to our operation. 
Please review this immediately, as I know we're not the only company.
If you had it in the Classic version, there is no reason why you can't add in the new version.",1
"Well.... classic invoicing has retired today and this feature has not been added, meanwhile I am currently having to raise an invoice with 42 lines in it, that has the same item 21 times on alternating lines.... so line 1 and 2 items are reapeated 21 times. The easiest way to way to do this on classic invoicing was to add as many lines as I needed then paste the item onto alternating lines for the first item and then repeat for the second item.

Now I have to either copy and paste lines one by one OR copy and paste all the lines required for one item, then all the lines required for the second item and then manually rearrange them into the correct order. What an absolute waste of time.",1
"Michelle - potential work around (not ideal but might save you time).  Make up a draft invoice (or draft quote) that can be easily copied to create a new invoice.  In this draft, make up your 42 lines but adding just 1 dot in the description field in each line.   Keep this draft as your template.  When it's time to make up an invoice, copy the template to create a new invoice - you can then paste in repeatedly into the lines you want  to overwrite the dot you originally put in.     If you're able to use a Produce or Service as your standard lines you put in repeatedly, even better.",2
Why did you try to fix something thats not broken. New invoicing is horrible,1

"New Invoicing - 'Find Address' field & 'Attention' field

We need the find address field as this helps verify the correct address was given by the customer.

We need the attention field as this is useful for notes other than the address (contact, c/-, contact number etc etc).",2
Make new invoicing fit on one screen - currently classic fits on one screen and is easy to use. Reduce the need to scroll and zoom/unzoom to have a consistent sizing approach across all invoicing/billing/reporting,2
"With the new invoicing, I need to scroll to see the whole invoice - we utilise the 2 category options.  If I remove one, its fine, but with the 2, I need to scroll across to see the amount.  Please can the layout go back to the more condensed version we had with classic.",2
"This is essential for any sort of audit trail.  Just having a note saying ""sent"" is completely unhelpful.  What if the client disputes that it was sent?

I agree with the comments here about an option for a compact view,2
"Seconded that - like the Bank Rec screen that I had to write custom CSS to un-clusterfk (which was so successful that Xero implemented most of it as 'compact mode').

The '.' still does not seem to work in the invoice date field?  The '/' works fine.,2
"Similarly, when adding payments to invoices, the 'Date paid' section now requires you to click into it and select a date off the calendar, and also the 'Account' selection, I used to be able to start typing the account the payment went into and select it by entering, now I have to use the mouse for these two items.
Can you please fix this as well?",2
"In the payment screen in New Invoicing, it is not possible to tab to the date field.  Why??!!!  Why must I take my fingers off the keyboard and engage the mouse to get to the date field or to the bank account field?

Being unable to do things without using a mouse fails WCAG Criterion 2.1.1 and means that this part of the program fails at being Accessible - this needs to be escalated by emailing accessibility@xero.com,1
"I received this reply:

""Idea: Payment screen in New Invoicing
 
Hi all, in new invoicing you should be able to Tab to any of the fields on the page including the Add Payment button. Alternatively, using the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-Y will open the payments modal.

Once this opens it'll default to the Amount Paid field, and you can Tab across to the Date field. Pressing Enter, space bar, or the down arrow will open the calendar picker, and you can Tab, then use the arrow keys to select the date you want.

If you're not getting this same behaviour we'd recommend raising a case with our Xero Support team through Xero Central where we can get a closer look with you 1:1.""

It's too bad that the Product Team doesn't know how the product actually works.  I j just tried this again and in the ""Add Payment"" window, you can only tab between the Amount Paid field and the Reference field.  You cannot tab to the Date field or the Account field.  It requires a mouse click.",1
"It's absurd that this hasn't been implemented in OVER a year!  Off the top of my head, there are at least 3 different user interfaces for date fields and the same for the account field.

When entering a payment on an invoice, it is maddening having to type an amount, mouse-click the date, mouse-click the account, and then type a reference.  I cannot begin to describe how slow this feels or how much of a workflow impedance it is.

I don't understand why the date field behaviour and list selection behaviour are not defined re-useable components and therefore exactly the same EVERYWHERE that type of field appears.  It appears that whoever codes a feature is re-inventing the UI instead of using a single set of common components.

Come on, Xero, get it together!  It is an absolutely HORRIBLE user experience that is becoming more and more expected as the norm in Xero - Beautiful by design (my).

Edited by Community manager to remove profanity.",0
"@Scott Osburne you technically CAN tab through the fields in the payment pop-up, but to change the date, you have to press space or enter when the date field is highlighted, then tab several times to get to the grid of dates (with the mouse cursor NOT over the grid because if it's over the grid then tab exits the grid), use the arrow keys to find the one you want, then press enter or space (if you press tab it goes to the next field instead of changing the date) when you have the right one highlighted, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SHIFT-TAB BACK FOUR TIMES TO THE ACCOUNT FIELD because the focus has dissipated and both tab and shift-tab move the focus to the Add button instead of the focus moving in a logical order (WCAG success criterion 2.4.3 failure).

If you could enter the date instead of having to tab and arrow etc it would be significantly fewer keypresses, even without the focus order failure.",1
Hello what is the update on this? The new invoicing is going live at the end of the month and we still can't edit the attention to name?,2
Moving the payment button to the bottom of the invoice as it is in classic would improve the flow of the invoice procedure.,2
"Why on earth would you think it was okay to remove the Invoice due date ""Today"" from the invoicing options??    I am sure I'm not the only person who invoices for payment in advance (ie pay today, your goods get shipped today) but now I have to actually select the date instead of choosing a nice simple button to select - adding more time to my invoicing day. 

It's the little things Xero!!",1
"It seams like everything they change just adds more clicks, not in any way is it reducing them! It is so frustrating and the lag/delay now is just adding even more time to complete simple tasks.",1
"The lag is ridiculous. You end up either doing the same task multiple times because it didn't register the first few times, or you miss a task because you think you've done it but you don't realise in your flow that it hasn't even saved (like adding attachments to an invoice).",1
Can we add an auto-save to the new invoices and cancel as well. thanks.,2
I'm here to add my frustration with the change to applying payments to invoices. Making it a button is HORRIBLE! Having to use a drop-down for the date is HORRIBLE! Please move it back to the way it was as a grid below the invoice. This redesign slows the process down AND has increased errors with dates. I'm glad to see you're planning to fix so that we can type in dates. Please get rid of the button and put the payment grid back where it was.,1
"Totally agree - the classic version is much better and faster than the new version in terms of all functionality.
Tried the new invoicing version, it took so long for it to load even with a couple of line items. Tried every month but see no improvement in this area. This is so inefficient and time wasting when you have so many invoices to raise each day.
Also, in the editing screen, you can't even see the full name of the GL Account, only the first 17 characters are showing. I even tried to zoom out of my browser, it still doesn't work. It's not user-friendly at all if you have to click on each GL code to review their full name for each line when you have 40-50 lines to review on the invoice. You also need to scroll horizontally to view all the invoice fields - again not user-friendly at all.
Besides that, the new auto-save function added maybe it's useful for some users. But, it would be great if we can choose to use that function or not. I'd prefer to make the changes and review the changes before clicking Save as draft.
I really hope the the classic version can stay. Or at least it should be extended to the point where all these issues have been resolved before you roll-out the new invoicing function. It's definitely worth for the product team to sit down and actually test out on the functions before they launch it.",1
"Well just over a month to go before they supposably close of Classic Invoicing and force all users to use an inferior user interface.

Have they listened to any users? Nope, still have not got New to anywhere near like the functionality and efficient layout of the Classic - actually the name sames its Classic -  judged over a period of time to be of the highest quality and outstanding of its kind.

Now on their, Xero, web site they say: We’re with you every step of the way
Our new and improved invoicing has been designed to bring you more flexibility and customization options – and help you get paid on time. We’re committed to evolving every product we offer, to create the best experience for our customers now, and into the future.

That is a lot of political cover up in my opinion and based on continual comments coming through I think a lot of users will agree.

They even go further and say: As always, your feedback is essential, so please share your thoughts on Xero Product Ideas. Your input ensures new invoicing can continue to meet and we hope, exceed your expectations as we evolve it. Please check out Xero Central for the latest updates and helpful resources. 

Have they (Xero) listened to users feedback - don't think so, still same old issues keep coming through on feedback including no proper history tracking, payment detail at top of invoice (Xero keep pushing for getting users to use their payment system - get paid quicker - will I don't want to so stop trying to push something onto me - its like spam in my opinion - would like to push this to the Commerce Commission - might be an idea.)

Anyway - I will stick with Classic until it dies - but must say Xero, users are not happy and I don't see how your shareholders can be - given you haven't paid them a dividend yet - as far as i know - and will this push to New drop the share price - it would in my opinion.

Ok, back to work on Classic invoice for a new sale - quick and easy in Classic horrible and time consuming in New :(.",0
"I just responded to a Xero Customer insights survey. Not happy, fix new invoicing before you retire Classic",1
"when invoicing on the new invoicing system the standard is set to ""Aprove & Email"" but it should be set to just ""Aprove""?

This is adding more work and mouse clicks to a busy workload..
when I want to send invoices by email, I send my invoice pdfs via my business email system so it can be tracked better but also it is better.

Also I print off invoices that get sent by post in a package or given by hand.

I am sure many other businesses will be the same, Xero should not assume all invoices are sent by email...!

I think the top main option should be ""APROVE"" and then if another option is required then it can be selected.
OR
Perhaps have two buttons 1) ""APROVE"" 2) ""APPROVE & EMAIL""

We need to keep to a simple streamlined work load that is logical.",1
"I agree. Having 2 approve buttons would be great. Or the ability to set a default per contact would be amazing. Maybe make it smarter, and if an email address is entered on the contact then I want to email it. If there is no email address then it's obvious I don't want to email it.

Also, you mentioned in the email today that the date picker has been improved, but not on the add payment screen. That still takes ages compared to before. Classic used to be Tab x 3, Press 1 or 2 to select the right account, then click Add Payment. Took about a second. Now everything is click, click, click, click, click, click. So inefficient. There is the ability to type in the account box, but you need to click the box first, and then it doesn't auto select the top option, still needs to be clicked again, so what is the point?",1
"I tried it again after the email this week. It still doesn’t work for me as I still have to click on several drop down lists to do what I used to be able to just tab through, I still can’t just type the date - you have to select from a drop down calendar - but I’m glad it no longer assumes every invoice is dated ‘today’. Entering a payment in an invoice takes several seconds longer. Multiply that by the amount of payments I deal with each week and new invoicing still adds unnecessary hours to my workload compared to using the old version, I can’t justify passing that cost for my time on to my clients when the workload has increased, just xero is forcing us to use a slower process from March.",1
"Appreciate the update Kelly, I only have one question and one MAIN reason that I refuse to go to new invoicing and that is the history. Has this been ""improved"" back to what happens in classic with the tracking of every time the invoice is emailed to the client with the date, time and email address????  This for me is a DEAL BREAKER and I've given up testing it.",1
"Thanks for the update, but there's not reference to these ongoing issues:

- When are you going to fix the issue with invoice numbering? I'm sick of having to manually determine what the last invoice number was to update when I delete a wrong invoice number. We still just get ""there must be an invoice number"" message and the just-deleted invoice number annoyingly put back in.

- When will you fix the issue with Invoice History and Notes?

These things are deal breakers for a lot of us. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't force us to use new invoicing at the end of February. You're ""new"" system isn't as robust as the classic invoicing. We don't want it! We want the full functionality of what we had. Feel free to keep adding new things no one really wants/asked for, but for the love of all things tech, PLEASE give us back the things we rely on. We do these tasks every single day and you're making it really frustrating to use your product.

Sidenote: when I login and you ask for a 2FA code, can you PLEASE make that field active so I can type the code in WITHOUT having to click or tab to the field. That one feels like a no-brainer to me.",1
Also ... can we bring back sending invoices from our own email address rather than the @xero address? Those continue to get lost in people's spam folders,2
"I don't use shortcut keys so no use to me. I tried the new invoicing layout and still hate it, still too much white space - should be nice and compact like classic, and still too many clicks to do anything. 

I checked the history for this one invoice and instead of 3 - 4 lines for the initial invoice in history I have 11 lines just to do one invoice. Every box clicked is reported as edited - don't need all that extra, I don't need to know I edited the reference change from to, or the due date changed unless I actually change the date at some point, how many lines are we going to end up if we have to go back in and edit something again later on.
This should be exactly the same as in classic, what a pain if I ever have to use this in future to prove who an invoice was sent to as they don't need to see all that as I PDF the history.

Seriously you have taken Xero backwards and still overlooking what people are actually saying and going ahead with things that add additional time to busy workloads already.

I actually dread year end work now given a lot of my invoices are issued at year end for the following year and having to use new invoicing is going to be a nightmare.",1
"@KellyMunro, there are 27 days until you force us to use the new invoicing layout and yet you are still claiming to be updating it to be more like the system that we want.  How crazy is that.  7 years in the making and it's still an abomination.  Classic works so why not allow us to continue with Classic?  You really are not listening to your clients.  All I can say is thank goodness I'm leaving my current employer today and when I start looking for a new job in a couple of months one of the questions I will be asking is what accounting system they use.  If it's Xero I won't even go for an interview, Xero is that bad now - you are just not listening to us.",0
"Sorry @Kelly, but so far all the changes in the new invoicing do not improve the workflow. There are more unnecessary clicks, and the buttons have been moved around to less efficient places.

What is the point of having to click a button to add payment when it was easy to have it at the bottom of the invoice? It is not an improvement",1
Have you been able to fix the auto fill of the  account code which selects random account codes.,2
"OK, the CTRL-ALT-A shortcut to approve rather than clicking the ""approve and email"" button is a good start.
The CTRL-ALT-Y shortcut to then record a payment is also a good start, but the record payment pop up doesn't allow for typing to select the date/account/etc, so it's still way slower than classic invoicing
It would also be useful to have hints on the page for the shortcuts, I never knew about those until following the link from Kelly's Jan 30th update",1
"I used to love xero. I told everyone I could about it. now I actually have come to hate parts of it. It's tech driven not customer centric. I would switch in a second if I heard of a better one, but I'm too busy to look and listen. My loss.. Plus the owner bought himself a 60million dollar home. Go figure. The new version is forced on us and i really HATE it. Everything takes longer. Its not logical. Let us use both.",0

"@Justine Quarrell 

Thank you for posting your comment about random account numbers. I noticed it as well! I guess it is connected to autosave problem. Autosave interrupts the workflow.

I hope the horrible autosave will be optional.",1

And no, e-Invoicing does not solve the problem, as some of our Xero companies are registered as one (with one business number) and are separated in Xero only for internal purposes.

"Am finding New Invoicing very slow and lagging.
When opening a draft invoice and removing a line it then takes ages to update the total and actually let me save it. Very frustrating and something that was not an issue in Classic. 
I need to be able to turn off auto save, it is creating duplications and causing it to be slow at responding to changes. 
Need to be able to select a default option for the approve button, approve and e-mail is not applicable to 95% of clients.
The keyboard work around is ok, but still not ideal.
Being able to enter payment details at the bottom needs to be put back, this was simple and it worked, there is no need for it to be anywhere else.  
We need this fixed and working before Classic is turned off.",1
"I agree with Charlotte. Also when adding product items you type the item number and it's not quick enough to bring up the details and this annoying new item screen pops up.

The autosave it's a pain, you don't have the cancel button anymore and if you want to cancel the invoice you need to go to drafts and delete it.

There are a lot of things to improve in Xero but invoicing is not one of them so I don't get why you are changing something that works.",1
"I'd like to see a commitment from Xero to not delete Classic invoicing until New invoicing has at least caught up with Classic in terms of features.

"@Kathy Skinner - "" don't use shortcut keys so no use to me. I tried the new invoicing layout and still hate it, still too much white space - should be nice and compact like classic, and still too many clicks to do anything.""

It seems that the UI team haven't grasped that what Apple/Satchi/et al aggrandize as great design for *advertising* doesn't make a great UI for productive work, and they seem to have completely missed that invoicing is a core tenet of an accounting system. 
I agree about the copious, useless whitespace. ""Here's a tiny view of an uploaded invoice that you can't read, because we wasted 3/4 of the page with padded whitespace. We don't care that its unusable, please vote for us in this year's design awards. We like Apple.""",1
"I thought I would try new invoicing again before the shutoff to see if it matched Classic invoice functionality but not yet.  So mouse heavy.  Too many clicks, too many tabs.  Buttons hidden under drop down menus.

The popup of last invoice entered hovers for less than 10 seconds. (In Classic it was at the top of the page)

Autosave causes data entry issues (missing numbers or values)

The History is a mess of ""Edit""s

Email invoices sent from New Invoicing have a different format and don't use my templates.  Looks like a demand for money now.  Can't set Organisation / Trading name if more than one business.

Classic invoicing works.  New invoices does not.  I think there is enough evidence of all the things wrong with the new version without me repeating everything that is wrong.  Please do not retire classic until the new is as good as the classic and offers the same flexibility. Thank you,1

Hi Rachel, thanks for your feedback. The switch from classic invoicing to new invoicing is a necessary step we're taking to improve your overall experience - and I can assure you it will get better! Based on customer feedback like yours, we've introduced 30 product updates in the past year, and we’ll keep making improvements.

For your convienience, we will be retiring old invoicing on the 27th.

"Hi Kelly,

The comments below are not directed at you personally, just Xero & are borne from extreme frustration.

Thank you for the update, but talk about getting the cart before the horse, wouldn't the survey BEFORE you started changing everything been a better idea!!!!

You've not mentioned extending the availability of Classic, so can only assume that New Invoicing is going to be forced on us on the 27th in the hope that we will get used to it & stop complaining.  Never going to happen!!

It's not like we are asking for the moon or anything, we just want the functionality & efficiency we currently have with Classic.

What I don't understand is that you could totally revamp the suppliers module (to make it the nightmare it is) without having to change the input screen, so why is this different??

Or is changing that the next little surprise you have instore for us??

Your telling us that Xero is listening, but I'm yet to see any evidence of that.

I used to love your product, now I am starting to hate it & if things continue down the same path as they have with all the changes over the last 12 months, I think I will be moving on & taking my 29 clients with me.",0
"Don't tell us you're engaged/listening/taking feedback. Feedback from day one on this has been that the new invoicing style is awful and literally nobody wants it. This is not something you can refine a bit at a time- it's not just a little rough around the edges, it's a total lemon. 

After seeing the warning again yesterday that from Thursday we're stuck using the new invoicing system I've just had to close my shop for the morning to start the process of switching software, which will easily cost me a couple of days of income this week to sort out. I couldn't possibly be more angry at Xero at this point, this is the epitome of being tone deaf.",0

"Another thing, not everyone emails their invoices. Have an approve button next to the approve and send button, another thing that is causing us to use more clicks.",2
"Given they've chosen to do this mid-financial year and make switching software more difficult than it could have been (probably not an accident), I've just asked them for a 1 month credit to be used at my convenience so I can reactivate at EOFY and let my accountant do his thing. I'd suggest anyone else who needs to now change software demands the same",1
BRING BACK THE EDIT BUTTON,1
Agree with Angela Collins. Not all of your clients 'approve & send'. Give us an easy option to just 'approve'. Please and thank you.,2
"Xero has forced the new invoicing without taking into account anyting said here, very frustrating!",1
"New invoicing is really disappointing. Compared to the previous version, the workflow is much more complicated and wastes a lot of time. Why try to change other people's work habits? For example, now when I input payment details, I can't directly use the keyboard to enter the date and account and use the tab key. I have to click with the mouse, which is a complete waste of time.",1
"When I get terribly frustrated with these Xero pain points I review other bookeeping software and to be fair, Xero is consistently the best of a bad bunch. All of them have difficulties, changing goalposts and workarounds. Every change to their software requires processes and procedures for businesses to be changed.

Anyway, I complained about the new invoicing on TrustPilot (I hate that the date requires mouse in and clicking around to backdate invoices - especially for accrual accounting, most of our invoicing is after the fact). This was their response (which to me points to improving the product for use by the mobile-holding business owner, and not for anyone else (accountants, office managers etc)):

Hello, thank you for sharing your feedback. We understand your frustration with the recent changes to the invoicing platform. Since the retirement of Classic Invoicing was announced, our Product Team have been actively listening to the feedback out customers have provided.
We have some exciting enhancements coming soon based on customer feedback, including easier row additions, reduced scrolling, drag-and-drop functionality, and real-time validation which should be introduced in coming weeks.
We’re committed to making New Invoicing even more powerful and efficient for you and when you think about the future invoicing features, none of this would be possible on our old technology. - ED",1
"Hi Maria, I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to share the information you received.  

It's actually the first feedback from Xero that I might even actually believe.",3

And can't help but wonder what the heck they have all been up to for the past year (and then some). We've been asking for the various features, that were inexplicably removed, to be reinstated for over a YEAR. 

When are we going to see them? Why are they not here already, working on go live day?? 

It's madness. Absolute madness.",1
"New style invoice is awful and not user friendly, takes longer and makes no sense.  No option to change it back so may switch back to Sage accounts.",0
Couldn't agree more.  The new style is dreadful.  Takes longer to process and more clicks / selections required.  It would be nice to have the option to go back to the classic style.  There was no need to fix what wasn't broken!,1
"I have to do about 25 unnecessary mouse movements per invoice.

The first two are moving the cursor to the ""contacts box"" and clicking; this should be the default position for the mouse when you open a new invoice, I should be able to simply start typing. There are so many basic issues with this, it is obvious that those who have been at the forefront of designing this ""new improved invoicing"" have never processed invoices as a job before, it's a complete mess.",1
"After mouse clicking Create Another Invoice why does it not default to the cursor in the Contact box to start creating your next invoice. The same situation happens when you click Business, Invoices, Create an Invoice again no cursor another mouse click and also when you click on the + Invoice option.
Please save us more clicks and have the cursor then default into Customer",1

"Thanks - good idea to email them though no doubt they'll come back with we've provided keyboard shortcuts lol - and using those for so much is making things even slower when you have to work out which ones to use.
No doubt no IT developer of this new invoicing has even been advised that this new option is breaching the standard.
Maybe also post on TrustPilot about this as well and any other issues that aren't being addressed - the more faults pointed out with Xero on their the more people will be aware -  maybe they'll end up listening in the end (or is that just wishful thinking lol)",1
"Please change back to classic new invoicing is horrible to use, clunky, the look makes creating invoices harder, it has gone back in time not to the future. change back",1
This garbage software is now marking invoices as both sent and unsent simultaneously. I just sent some invoices and history says they were unsent and sent with the exact same timestamp. What the **** is this? I can't even work out if my f***ing invoices are even sent now.,0
"We use categories on our invoicing to assist with reporting on multiple divisions.  These categories are set up in our Contacts and used to populate the field on each line item automatically in Classic Invoicing.  

Unfortunately, this is no longer the case with New Invoicing, and I have just had to click into each category field on each line of a 40 line invoice to then select the category entry!

We have invoices that also need to have a project selected in a similar fashion.  

It's just absurd that, in the new and ""improved"" invoicing system does not include a way to allocate the whole invoice to a category and/or project!

This approach, along with so many other issues previously documented in this discussion by so many, is not an acceptable invoicing process and has us seriously considering the merits of continuing to use Xero.",0
"The new invoicing has made my month end a nightmare! The new invoice takes so much time, when you type the item number/name it takes time to bring the right product and if you press tab quicker than the system you get a stupid pop up to create a new item, it wastes so much time.

The thicker lines are a pain, when you split your screen so you have Xero in one side and the invoices in the other, you can't  see eveything propertly but even when using the whole screen it's awful to see these chunky lines. 

The approve button is still at the top and hidden under Approve and email, it took me much more time to raise all the invoices for month end.

All the time we pointed out what was wrong with the new invoicing and apart to force the use, they didn't improve anything and they don't even reply to us here.

So frustrating! I will go to Trustpilot to write a review.",1
The new system is not fit for purpose and needs to be scrapped.,1
Don't forget that new invoice is also very slow loading.,2
"Remember folks, each time you encounter a bug or something that is obviously broken, you need to lodge it as a ticket. We need to flood them with tickets so they cannot ignore it as easily as they can these comment sections.

Also, I've made it my personal pet goal to comment on every ad of theirs I see on Facebook and I encourage you all to do the same, in addition to posting reviews on sites such as Trustpilot.

We need to file complaints with our relative authorities, citing that they are charging for a service that has been removed and/or had capabilities reduced, they are causing un-compensated losses for our companies and, in certain jurisdictions, creating issues that may cause our businesses to run afowl of tax/revenue authorities by way of record and auditing requirements.",1
"We are extremely frustrated with Xero's recent change to email branding, which now forces our invoices and communications to include the Xero logo. This change makes our company look unprofessional and cheap, as if we are using a third-party service rather than managing our own finances.

Branding is crucial for maintaining trust and credibility with our clients, and this decision undermines that. As a result, we are now reverting to manually sending invoices outside of Xero to maintain our professional image—adding unnecessary time and effort to our workflows.

We urge Xero to reconsider this approach and allow businesses to control their own branding in client communications. Please provide an option to remove Xero branding from emails.",1
"Bring the Classic invoicing back, please. The new changes cause too much error and time waste.",1
Im guessing Xero are ignoring all our requests to bring back the classic invoicing.,1

"You need to note that in the FY25 Xero report, they (boldly, 56pt font) say ""“WE CONTINUE TO DO WHAT WE SAID WE WOULD DO, AND WE’RE WELL POSITIONED TO CAPTURE THE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY AHEAD”

The ""significant opportunity ahead"" is gaining customers - growth at all costs, including destroying their reputation. Satisfying existing customers is an outright cost which requires good decisions, good UI, good planning, which Xero's current mgmt seems to not be capable of.

The only way existing customers (like us) are going to get any traction is either talking to potential customers and letting them know how much of a disaster this is, or making noise as a shareholder.
Any noise on this forum will get a response from only one group at Xero: the CS team, who insulate the managers from the unrest, and are excellent at ""We are listening ..."" statements. 
Buy 1 share, attend ALL meetings, make noise.
If you purchase your sub via your accountant, let them know that you are looking to change from Xero. 

Raising bugs in this forum used to be effective when Xero were small, growing, nimble. Now they are more like IBM - puppets on strings, and the users have no influence on the strings, only the shareholders",1
"One more thought ... 
There is another company, Microsoft, who had (arguably) a great software product at one point, but destroyed that potential because (in part) they employed the ideas of ""change for the sake of change"" and ""any change must be for the benefit of the shareholders, not the users"". 
If you look at a modern Microsoft product, its mostly advertising, no real progress on key features, and many many features lost including stability and security. Anti-malware is almost unheard of in Mac and Linux, but mandatory for windows. UI speed is worse despite the fastest chips in history and huge amounts of available RAM, and local search is slower then ever, with ""progress"" bars that don't actually mean anything. This is where Xero is heading.

Do you remember Microsoft tried to get rid of the start menu? They claimed that their telemetry showed that ""few people used the start menu""
In Invoicing, its not rocket science to understand that most users will create an invoice and email it. In ""New"" invoicing, emailing that invoice has been pushed from a dedicated button, to a link hidden in a submenu. This is Xero's ""get rid of the start menu"" moment, and shows how dedicated they are to enshitifying the product.
Microsoft's drive was to remove the start menu so that a full page ""app picker"" would be the standard way to start apps - because then, you have the real estate to show ads. That's what it was all about - enshitifying the experience , making it much worse for users, in return for a few cents of advertising revenue for shareholders of microsoft.",1
"Why do we have no choice if to change to the new version or not??
Some of us may be quite happy to stay the same rather than having to keep changing the way we use Xero, this is just a means of invoicing (Getting paid) don't need to get more and more complicated.",1

Having to click a button to apply a payment and the now multiple clicks on these fields slows the process. Seriously, why would you change the Account field to a drop down only with a search function after you select/click on it? We used to be able to tab to it, type one or two letters, and tab to the reference field. And, why in the world can't we type in the Date paid field? I can type a date WAY faster than it takes to click-click, and let's hope the payment was a different month or year. Yay, it's January, year-end time, and we have to click to change a month and year for EVERY payment we post for last month. Don't forget to change the year first or you'll have to start over. Ask me how I know. Did a Xero customer suggest these changes or did you just come up with it all on your own? 🤯🤮",1
"@Ross Persson and if you use Tab forwards then Tab back to get to be able to type in the contact (because being able to do everything with the keyboard is an Accessibility thing) it works, but you can't Tab to delete what's already written because pressing space with the delete highlighted brings up the contact details (pressing enter works, but which out of space and enter mean 'do the thing' is pretty inconsistent throughout the program). And I shouldn't need an extra two keyboard presses to get to the first input field in any case!

WCAG success criterion 2.1 fail.",1
"Another WCAG fail, and a UI fail in general, is that timing matters a whole lot. For example, on the ""new"" (******) invoice UI, tab into the ""item"" field and type (for example) ""tes"" and press tab. 

If you have an item with the name ""test"" , one of two things will happen;
- the item ""test"" will be selected and fill in the invoice line.
- the item ""test"" will not be found, and you will open the ""add item"" popup window. 

The determining factor for which behaviour happens is unknown to the UI team. They cannot seem to understand, or care, or be allowed to care, that non-deterministic behaviour in a UI makes the UI absolutely useless. Invoicing is a critical module, possibly the most important module in the system, and they failed so badly.",0
"One more comment to explain the previous comment - the behaviour i described is all down to the speed of various things. If the item list has loaded, and you type and tab just slow enough, you will get the desired behaviour. If you type fast (which most users who have bookkeeping roles absolutely do) then you are likely to frequently get the undesired behaviour. 

So the classic invoicing system worked, but the new invoicing system doesn't work for fast users - exactly the group that should be prioritised.

And xero doesn't seem to care.",1

"We use this daily for intercompany transactions between different Xero entities. An email solution is too unreliable. And the user should not have to remember to back out to the invoices list view to select and send via the Xero Network -- that should be an option, but the ability to send should be at the individual invoice level, just like it used to be and like it is for emailing invoices.",2
I agree with all comments here we use Xero to Xero invoicing for sending 60+ intercompany invoices per month and if this feature is retired it will create so much inefficiency and a world of chaos for the amount we use and rely on this function. Please really consider bringing this feature back.,1
"I agree with all the comments here. We use Xero to Xero to process intercompany invoices and is one of the main reasons which drove me to migrate to Xero.

Using hubdoc and e-invoicing is not an option because we do not have the time to scan through each document and e-invoicing is not available in all jurisidctions. We maintain intercompany entities in different jurisdictions including those that does not support e-invoicing via Peppol. Please do not retire old invoicing until the new invoicing supports this feature.",1
"Please update Xero to Xero instruction.  It is confusing because this feature is not available in New Invoicing.  At this moment we do not know whether this feature will be ""developed"" into New Invoicing.

Xero to Xero invoicing is a very important feature that should not overlook or missed in development phase of the new invoicing.  It is a shame that it is now missing!

Adding another step to send Xero to Xero invoicing in awaiting payment page is unnecessary and time consuming.  It defeat the purpose of efficiency, user-friendly that Xero uses to sell its product.

Hubdoc is good but Xero to Xero Invoicing is a different level of efficiency in this case.

Not able to send invoice pdf as attachment via Xero network creates more workload to check & delete emails.  It is totally unnecessary when the same invoice pdf can be sent via Xero to Xero invoicing by default.

Please seriously look into it and implement the necessary.",1
"With some of my customers, one parent company might conduct a lot of activity on behalf of a subsidiary and then bill it back. With Xero to Xero, I can use the “assign expenses to a customer” feature and then easily itemize each expense line by line for the subsidiary. 

Xero to Xero invoicing is integral for this process because dozens of expenses may be recouped from the customer in one invoice, and when the invoice is exported to the subsidiary’s Xero profile via Xero to Xero, all activity is itemized exactly the same as the invoice, saving all the time it could take to itemize each expense over again.

This is one of the key reasons to encourage clients with multiple subsidiaries to use Xero; it is such a unique and useful tool, it would be senseless to get rid of it. I can’t understand why such a seemingly simple yet very effective feature would be retired.",1

Please update us on when the Xero-to-Xero connection will be introduced in New Invoicing. It has been under review since September last year!",1

I agree complete with Sarah Tichenor - 
The use case for my clients is a parent company forwarding expenses to subsidiaries or franchisees. Xero to Xero lets you export the invoice to the Franchisee via Xero to Xero.  It saves a lot of recoding of GL Codes.",2
e-invoicing is poorly developed in the UK (the help screens talk about Australia & New Zealand).  Also e-invoicing is unavailable if you or your customers are not VAT registered.  It is frustrating that Xero don't understand their own product!,1
It’s just ridiculous to make us all take this backward step and retire the Xero to Xero network. Meanwhile increase prices disproportionately. New invoicing is already slower and more painful to use. This on top is majorly frustrating. Seeing your media adverts currently makes me want to throw a brick at my tv!,1
I need to send the invoice detail from one inter-related company to another without having to reinput 20 lines of detail. Please ensure this can continue.,2
The link for eInvoicing isn't working. And the option Xero to Xero Network is not available on the suggestion you made for send these throught Invoices awaiting payments list so that doesn't work either... Any other solutions available?,1

Fortunately there is a Cloud Convert feature whereby you migrate from Xero to Sage for free with 2 years' data.

Let's see if Xero misses my 291 subscriptions that I am moving to Sage next month.... And then hopefully take it as a lesson learnt to listen to their clients.

"I am at a total loss as to why Classic invoicing will be retired before the Xero to Xero feature has been included. It is ridiculous. I am still using Classic Invoicing. To send Xero to Xero invoices through payment lists is an incredible time wasting seven steps instead of one in Classic invoices. E-Invoicing does not even come close to Xero to Xero. 
If that worked for inter-related companies, we would all be using it for goodness sake. 
Come on team. This is so frustrating from a user point of view. We pay for the service don't we? And you have seen fit to introduce a New Invoicing without an existing significant key feature, a feature that swayed many to change to Xero..

I see somone has migrated to Sage. I might have a look at that as well.",0

"@Elizabeth Thorburn, you can now send via Xero to Xero network, but it’s fiddly (as is everything in new invoicing). 
You have to come out of the invoice and go to the Awaiting Payment list. Tick the invoice. Press Email, then make sure you tick Send by Xero Network. 
It’s not ideal as you can only send one at a time this way. It also means you have to Approve the invoice without emailing, which involves a dropdown from the ridiculous default Approve and Email button. All extra work and easy to make mistakes and end up emailing twice. That will annoy clients. The whole set up is absurd.",1
"I contacted Support about this issue on the first day it changed over - we have over 100 entities we oversee and losing this feature has essentially doubled our workload. This is the response I got - pretty much saying I should lodge to ""add this as a feature we would like to see"" I shouldn't have to ask for a feature you already had.

From your query, it sounds like you would like to be able to access the Xero Network feature from within the invoice itself, like in Classic Invoicing.


This is a request that's already been raised with us and I've found an idea that's similar to what you’re suggesting in our Xero Product Ideas. Xero Product Ideas is a Xero website where our customers can share and support ideas for change. Here you can support it or create a new idea to share your thoughts. I can see on the idea this is something our Product teams are working on.",1
"Xero decided to show a deaf ear to our request, and decided to enforce the New Invoicing without the EXISTING FEATURE.

"Hi Xero, please hurry up and introduce the Xero-to-Xero network! It has become a nightmare for intergroup invoicing since you retired Classic Invoicing! This dramatically increases admin time for intergroup reconciliation and invoicing.
We operate in different countries, and e-invoicing (as advised as an alternative) does not work for us! We also have separate Xero subscriptions for the same registered company but with separate trust funds, so e-invoicing is not a solution either.
February has been ruined because the Xero-to-Xero link does not work on repeating invoices, forcing us to spend hours rechecking all intergroup invoices and allocating them to the appropriate entity—when before, we could simply open the draft bills and approve them!
What have you done, Xero?!!",1
"Hi Kelly

When CLASSIC was RETIRED it wasn't blown to smithereens — was it?
It's still there — isn't it?
It's just turned off — correct?
Surely it wouldn't take very much to ""flick the switch"" and turn CLASSIC back on — correct?
And this must be a hot topic of discussion at management level within Xero — correct?

We get that some people will feel like they have egg on their faces if they admit NEW Invoicing has been a monumental fail — they just need to keep their egos in check

No-one cares that they gave it a red hot go and it didn't work, good on them for having a go — but don't keep flogging this dead horse (NEW) — be brave, pull the pin, turn CLASSIC back on — and be our hero ... CAPTAIN CLASSIC

Otherwise — could you please have this proposal put in front of Xero Management ... Xero customers wanting to use CLASSIC pay an additional amount per month — I don't know, 50 bucks or something — because currently the nightmare of using NEW is costing me more than $600 a year — plus the extra stress is just a heart attack waiting to happen 

Please ask them to be one of the first technology companies to admit they got it wrong, to listen to their customers and to provide the software solution their very loyal customers have supported for many years 

Or offer both — CLASSIC and NEW — charge a premium for CLASSIC, I don't care how its done ... I just need CLASSIC back and I'm not alone 

VOTE 1 FOR CAPTAIN CLASSIC ... making the boring lives of us CFOs / Financial Controllers / Finance Directors / Finance Managers / Finance Department Team Members just that little bit brighter with every saved keystroke ... ""To Infinity and Beyond”

"Can you please tell me why the new invoicing is SOOOOO SLOW, it drives me crazy just to open a saved invoice or add a new on, I may as well click the button and go make a coffee.  BRING BACK CLASSIC INVOICING.",0
"NEW INVOICING:
WHAT A MESS
1. If you have to amend and account code (which XERO got WRONG in the first place), if a payment has been made, you have to firstly remove the payment, then edit the invoice then update then go in to reconciliations and re-apply the payment. If the payment was in a batch, you have to re apply payments for the whole batch.
If the re-coding does not affect the gst status you should NOT have to undo the payment.You certainly didn't have to in classic invoicing. Try it. It is a huge waste of time, totally unnecessary, very frustrating and annoying.

2. When entering a Contact, the ""Create new contact"" option should be at the bottom of the list. You are much more likely to use an existing contact than create a new one. The same applies to inventory. Take the ""Create New"" to the bottom of the lists.

3. Approve an Invoice. You have to hit the drop down menu to APPROVE an invoice. ""Approve and email"" is the default. It is handy to be able to Preview/Print an invoice before sending on. To do this you have to Approve. To Approve you have to use the drop down menu. MORE TIME. MORE CLICKS.

4. How are they going with Xero to Xero invoicing? We all know how long that now takes. We are a week off the end of March and still no news.

The best solution to the debacle we are trying to use at the moment is just admit you have a long way to go and bring back Classic Invoicing until you have New Invoicing working.

I look forward to a straight down the line response. Please, we don't need politican type answers. Give us some credit. I am so sick of this",1
"The costs in this invoice (partial invoice history attached) are costs I want to on-bill from a related entity using projects. The bill has not yet shown up in the related entity - note that it is over two hours after it was sent via e-invoicing - so I've had to create the invoice on-billing to the eventual client as if the bill had arrived, and I'll have to do a whole lot of mucking around to get it all connected in that related entity that I wouldn't have to do if Xero-to-Xero worked in New Invoicing. E-invoicing is great, but does not complete things in the timely manner that I NEED for inter-entity billing!",1
"We realized this functionality was enabled in our firm’s Xero.  We have been used to send via Xero Network one by one.  However, I wonder if it works to send automatically to customers once invoices are created if the Xero Network key is set in the corresponding contact.  I am not sure it works in that way.",1

Please compare the 2 screenshots I added. 
On another note, can you please explain why you are unable to allow the old and new version to coexist as it is the case now? I have seen hundreds of complaints about the new invoicing. Whose purpose does the new invoicing fit? If we are happy with current version, why force us to switch to an inferior version?
Please respond. Thank you.",1
"Hi Mirela,

For the time being, there is a workaround for this issue.

You can run a report ""Receivable Invoice Detail"". There in the filter under Status you can tick Draft if you want to check your draft invoices before theiy are approved. Group it by Invoice Number. Check that under Columns Account is ticked. Then you can check all your draft invoices at a glance. Also, you can reorder columns as you wish to make it easier for your eyes.",2
"Hi Olga

Thank for your response. You can understand though that a report cannot replace checking invoices one by one and correcting them on the spot. What do we do if 10 invoices out of 50 need correction? Do I write them down and go back to each to correct them? Do I write down which line is wrong before I do that? It may sound like a workaround but it might take 10 times the time to do.

Can you please answer my second question as well? Why the new and old invoicing cannot coexist? I am a former programmer and I know for sure they can. It can be configurable. 

In my 16 years as a software developer I never saw any version being terminated before the new one passes UAT (user acceptance testing). The announcement that old invoicing will be retired in February is a shame to the XERO product managers and quality assurance managers. A beta version needs to be released and who wants to use it can, until all issues are fixed. You simply cannot go live with unfinished product. Can you please report my comments to higher management and provide proper explanation? We are paying customers and this practice is unacceptable.",1
"Mirela,

I am a bookkeeper, an ordinary user as you are :).

If you need to correct 10 out of 50 invoices it is easy to do via that report. When you spot the wrong account you can click on the line of the report, it will open the invoice in question, and you can correct the ledger account. I attached a sample of this report. I deleted all dollar value columns in it. 

I was and am advocating for classic invoicing in Xero community. You can check this link. It is the most popular.

https://central.xero.com/s/question/0D53m00009lxGKdCAM/new-invoicing-layout?fromEmail=1&s1oid=00Do0000000biwC&s1nid=0DB1N0000008Yml&s1uid=0053m00000CmI4l&s1ext=0&emkind=chatterCommentNotification&emtm=1721086546824

Xero did read this discussion; they organised several online meetings with users. I took part in one of such meetings. Due to this discussion Xero agreed to postpone the classic invoicing retirement. But it will be retired on 27.02.2025. Yes, it’s a pity that we are losing our beloved beautiful Xero. It is not beautiful anymore, it’s ugly. And, yes, I totally agree with you about UAT.

They gave us the only explanation: classic invoicing platform is old and not compatible with the new world of online based software. There were several discrepancies (or outright lies) in their statements. For example, Diya Jolly posted in her blog that they had to do double work for everything to keep classic and new invoicing on par. Why then new is a downgraded version of classic? I guess we will never know it.",1
Agree here - i think the price column is much more wide than it needs to be so either a smaller font to fit everything in or an ability to change widths on each column and that preference is remembered each time you create a new invoice - rather than having to adjust each time,1
Agree - the fact that you cannot adjust the column width or see the full account code. My team and I are still waiting on this to be released. Good that you are working on it hopefully sooner than later.,1
"This was probably the main reason why I kept using classic invoicing instead of moving to new invoicing. It was just to difficult to review draft invoices when I couldn't see the full account names. It's been many months since this significant user issue was raised, and many months since Xero advised 'working on it'. Is there any timeframe yet when this basic functionality will be reinstated?",1
"Agree with Alastair below, this fix is taking too long and slowing us down every day",2
"I've found this in response to a support ticket (where I was asking about roll-out) I'm shocked that people need to keep a manual spreadsheet. . While the support agent directly says this is where to go for info, it appears that it's nearly 5 months since the comment he refers to. Below is the response to the support request. Interesting Ethos for support.


The reason we don't make our Development Plan public is so that we can retain flexibility regarding features included in releases. We do mention some planned features on our blog, but as others are more susceptible to change, we'd rather under-promise and over-deliver than vice versa.

I have also included a link to Xero product ideas in which our community manager has responded clarifying why this roll out has not occurred for all customers yet.",2
"Hi Kelly,

Dare I ask when this will be available for existing customers?  It's almost been a year since this post!  or is this just another empty promise",1
"Nicole leave report shows in days as does on employee leave screen
Where else does it show in hours? 
Im new to payroll

Would love annual leave to be in days as well - cant see why it isnt - other payrolls show in days",2
"Hi Claire,

My leave reports and employee screen both show sick leave in hours.  I have been with Xero for years.  
If you are new to payroll you probably have the latest version which customers joining after 5 August 2024 have and shows sick leave in days. 

For some reason Xero isn't making this available to existing customers when new customers have had it for over a year.",1
"It is a very backward step to only be able to access the first 50 items of inventory when raising an invoice.
Classic invoicing does not have this problem so this is a step back into the dark ages.",1
"I trust that you are going to keep classic invoicing available until this issue is fixed!

The deadline is getting closer.",1
about ready to quit xero over this first 50 only issue. Almost unusable when you have alot of products and dont always know the exact name,1
"Can the new invoicing item search pop-up be more compact? We used to be able to see so many more items at once with the classic invoicing. With the new invoicing, I find myself doing a lot more scrolling. We have a lot of items that are very similar in name and nature and we would like to be able to see more at once.

As with the New Invoicing in general, there seems to be a lot of unnecessary blank space and I don't believe it needs to be as big as it currently is. Quite frankly, we don't need to see the description. Maybe others do but every item should have it's own name and code making the description unnecessary (at least for us).

Also, the search feature seems considerably slower and there is a delay when you start typing.",1
"I agree and this is the main reason why I have only started using the new invoicing system now as I have no other option.

When I add a billable expense to the invoice it doesn't use the item code so then it never shows that I have sold it in products and services, even though I have.

With the old invoicing I find that I can look back at a bill and see exactly who we sold that product to at a quick glance, now this won't happen.",1
Its very disappointing that billable expenses has not been fixed entering the item code.   This will add significant time to my invoicing.   Researching other accounts packages,1
"When is the item code going to be added to the billable expenses. Not having this feature is causing a huge amount of extra work, its taking me three times are long to even charge the customer and products are still being missed.  Come on Xero, we pay good money for your program, get it right, PLEASE!!!!",1
"This feature is worthless without pulling in the original line data!  Who wants to go back and look up line data on let's say, 30 transactions?  This has made one invoice take HOURS to create and this is so disappointing.  The date of the transaction has disappeared as well.  The bigger Xero gets the worse its functionality gets for everyday accounting items.  PLEASE make this work!",1
"All, please upvote this idea so we can get the attention of whoever is making these decisions. I recently received this response from Xero when I submitted a ticket for this problem (back when we could still use classic invoicing):

""Our Product team have confirmed the item code won't automatically populate on the invoice, so you'll need to manually add the item code to the item line. However, Xero will still recognise this as a billable expense when you've added it.""

This is a needed feature. Just like others have said, not having the original item code automatically populated has added extra time to my invoicing process. I can have as may as 50 billable expenses that need to be added and now I must manually search for each item code.",1
"Thank you Xero! This worked today!!!! What a relief to have this feature back. Now that item codes are pulled in for billable expenses, the new invoicing actually represents an improvement for my purposes. Thank you for addressing this request.",4
"This is still not working for me,  is there supposed to be a fix ?",1
This is not working for me either. No billables is causing me no much extra work and errors. PLEASE fix this or at the least let us know what you are doing about it.,1
"This is still not working for me either. Patricia Hopper, can you show us how it worked for you?",2
"Is this working properly for anyone?  If so, please can you share how?  If not, Xero - please get this working for us - it is causing a very high level of extra work for our team.  Thank you.",2
"It's working for me 99% of the time. I'm not sure why or how...wish I could offer a better answer than that for those of you who still aren't having product codes for billable expenses carryover to invoicing. Nearly all of my invoicing is done via billable expenses so having these codes track over is critical for us. Most of my product codes are formatted as ***-xx-*** and those began populating into my invoices a couple weeks ago. My one anomaly - product code ""SHIP"" usually does not pull into the invoice but sometimes randomly does. I haven't paid close enough attention to find a correlation as to why that code doesn't always pull in.",1
"Thanks for the update. However, I find the payroll limitations within each plan frustrating. As a small business with two employees, the need to upgrade to the third tier just to add a part-time hire feels restrictive. It does not seem like adding an extra employee to payroll would significantly impact Xero’s costs, yet it forces small businesses like ours into a higher-priced plan.",1
"I totally agree with Joana. It appears that I will have to move to Xero Ultimate just to run a payroll for 6 people? I don't need a lot of the other added features, just a basic package with the ability to add more people to the payroll.",1
"I too am being forced from a Standard plan to the Ultimate just because I have 8 employees. This is basically 50% more than I am currently paying.  Our current plan allows for additional staff members at a realistic cost, so cannot see why this feature cannot be continued.  I will be forced to pay for Analytics, Multiple Currencies (asphalt contractor, bit hard to export!!), and Projects which we also do not use. We will never need any of these features.  Please add back the ability to have more employees without being ripped off for products that aren't applicable to us.",1
This was announced that you would be reverting the payroll pricing in December 2024 yet here we are in April 2025 and still no update on this. That is a lot of money people have practically wasted waiting on this being corrected. Any further forward with this before people start leaving Xero completely,0
"Please allow us to have payroll access and pay for extra staff as needed instead of forcing us onto Ultimate. I have 6 employees and only use payroll, vat and accounting. Standard plus payroll 1..x should be an option.",2
"This is a really ****** way to treat small business. I run a two person  show and are now being forced onto the grow plan. I just need the payroll. I have no interest in invoicing or expenses.

Man, how I loved xero, now every time I load it up I just think how I am paying double+ for no extra value. Its a pure money grab.

Hopefully my anger subsides, but will be looking at other options, which I know my accountant will not be happy with.",0
"Hi Kelly,
Capital and Tax Losses brought forward.
All types of returns.
P.s. why would you rollover the Losses Schedule from the prior year into a Losses Worksheet this year? Why not roll it into a Losses Schedule? The way Xero works with Losses/Schedule/Worksheets is so silly. E.g. if I have a small amount of carried forward capital losses in a trust return, it will carry over the losses as brought forward losses to the current year return, I can even edit this, but if there is a small capital gain in the year and some losses recouped, I can't adjust the carried forward losses without creating a losses schedule or worksheet (even though the ATO tax return instructions say I don't have to add a losses schedule or worksheet to the return!).",1
I need to know this information so that my firm can maintain its discount,2
"In the new invoicing mode, when you copy an invoice for a customer, those customer's default payment terms (default due date) is not used. Can this be rectified? Have been using the old invoicing style to copy invoices to date, concerned that using the old invoicing is being deactivated shortly.",2
"Another month-end with more incorrect VAT rates on invoices going out to clients - this is so frustrating and not something that we had problems with previously!

Please can you review this request again - what is the point in setting defaults in contacts, when they only work on new invoices? Copying prior invoices is so important when you have repeating business, we use this every time we raise an invoice and for it to not be using the defaults as set against the contact is causing so many issues - VAT being the major one!",1
When copying a new sales invoice from a previous invoice the due date defaults to company settings rather than contact settings - this is inconvenient to say the least as you can't remember the payment terms for every customer - that is the whole point of being able to to set default terms.,2
"Ongoing issue with ""new invoicing"" since we changed over in July 2024:

When we copy an invoice to create a new invoice, there is still the issue of Xero automatically calculating to our company's 14 days payment terms from invoice date, not the client's eg: 30 days from invoice date (which is already set up in Xero against the client). We have a large number of clients with a variety of different payment terms (which are entered in against the individual contact in Xero).

All Xero has done is add a warning box to say ""defaults"" won't automatically be copied across & the only way to fix it is to remove the client completely & then add them back in again.

This is just making the invoicing process take longer which is extremely frustrating & very time consuming having to re-calculate each one (due to the high number of daily invoices).

This was never an issue with Classic invoicing. It would automatically update the due date based on the individual client's payment terms. Classic invoicing would also re-calculate the due date when the invoice date changed when draft invoices were ready to be sent.",1
I believe this has been fixed!!  I just ran invoices this morning and it looks like the payment terms of the client are updating in the copy to draft option.,3
"Jodi Herbein,

Yes, I checked it. And the payment terms were applied correctly! However, the warning pop-up window is still there. Maybe they forgot to remove it?",3
"I do not understand why the development team didn't notice this issue in testing. I use this function on the daily and it drives me mad having to drag across the text to scroll over, it needs to be fixed ASAP.",1
This has slowed down our processing time. Please address.,2
Surely it can auto-size so that we can actually see it all on the one screen.  Just a coding issue.,2
"I'd also like to add: you can't scroll without using a mouse UNLESS you have tabbed in to the list, which is not something you'd do if you were scanning a list that is currently in the foreground. If you use the arrow keys on your keyboard to attempt to scroll the list that is in the foreground without having tabbed into the list, all it does is scroll the whole page. You can't tell that the keyboard interaction focus point is still on the background and not the window that just popped up. It's not meeting Accessibility requirements.",2
Another example of making the product worse & take more time than it did with the old system.  The ability to create a bill or invoice that adds up to $0 is essential!,1
"We have been promised this is 'coming' (2 employees/payroll in Grow) but it hasn't happened as yet. I'm sick of  small businesses like ours being ripped off.  I just had to upgrade to Comprehensive for a couple of months, just so I could pay a 2nd worker.  Now we learn Comprehensive is going up in price to $100/month.  It's really too much for a small business like ours that will never have more than a couple of employees.  I guess Xero only really cares about the bigger fish.",1
Same comment here. We'd like to be able to add multiple lines in one go.,2
"Yep, same here. We asked for the add lines function that was previously available to be reinstated. And yet again we're being asked to 'vote'/beg for it.
Sure, having an add lines button is progress, but really Xero? Really?",1
Same comment here. We'd like to be able to add multiple lines in one go.,2
"please bring back to add multiple lines, I use this in the everyday invoice and its taking double the time because I have to add these individually.",2
"One of the dumbest moves ever when you removed it. Put it back and give us back all the things you took away when you forced us to use this ""new"" invoicing dog's breakfast.",1
"With new invoicing  for 20 additional lines I have to click 20 times ""add row"", when previously one click would do it. This is the improved version?",1
"Quite unbelievable that you would remove the option for adding multiple lines in invoicing, but have it remained for entering bills. Backward move on the part of Xero designers and clearly not listening to the needs of many. Please return to the option you can add 5, 10 or 20 lines.",2
Just add the multiple lines in for Invoicing.  Why do we need to keep commenting before this is implemented - Xero get your act together.,1
"As per the consensus in these comments, please please please add back in the 5, 10 & 20 addition lines.  Even if you only add the 20 line option it would save so much work.  This is just bonkers Xero!!",1
"Bring back date entry the same as classic invoicing - so annoying have the dropdown calendar every time and why has the ability to use . instead of / on date entry - which is much easier input.
Seems to be that the most popular thing to do is revert it back to classic invoicing permanently.",2
Adding a payment is such a waste of time. Before I can just type the date then tab to the account and finish entering a payment without any clicking with the mouse. Now the new invoicing is so annoying. can't be more disappointing with the dropdown menu.,2
"And please allow ""."" as a date separator, not just ""/"".",2
"And move the Add Payment function back to the invoice screen.  Why must we open another window, with ANOTHER mouse click, to add the payment.  And, also, if it has to remain a separate window don't shade out the window behind.  it's so faint that I can't see the invoice date very well (in the small font that I have to use in order to see the entire invoice window on my screen...another complaint about this terrible system).",1
Sorry Xero but this is so important in new invoicing. I see it can now be done with payment. Why not the invoicing,1
This is driving me mad.  Why can't I type it in,1
Surely there are enough complaints about the new invoicing that either the old classic should be re-activated or all the issues rectified without delay.  This has got to be the most user unfriendly program I've ever had to work with.,1
"I just joined, fleeing from QBO. Is there really no selection for 30 day terms?",2
"@THOMAS ROGERS - you can define 1 default payment term (like 30 days) in the overall invoice settings, but it will use that for all invoices automatically, but you can change the due date to whatever you want.

Otherwise, the pre-selected options are 7 Days or 14 Days, or 1st of next Month, 20th of next Month, End of next Month. Kind of strange options, especially for the US subscription, as these are not really standard payment terms in the US.

We are looking to implement payday super in the near future too. Would be great to see this implemented in Xero's payroll before it is legislated.,2
"QB has this feature in their payrun, it makes it superfast and easy to process for payday super",2
I can't believe this has not already been done.,2
"I've noted that there is a shortcut to the super payment page available in new payruns - once the payrun has been posted, there's some extra buttons, once of which has a dropdown with a link that currently takes you to the super payment page (you still have to do the super run as normal, but if you're doing that with every payrun, it's already halfway to marking this idea as delivered)",3
"Regardless of when you process the super payment from Xero, I've noticed it takes a week to hit the employees super account which is slow. Payday super states it needs to be there within 7 days so wonder how prompt this will be once the payment volume increases when payday super starts 1Jul. MYOB was similar so they need to improve the processing speed.",2

This is messing with my muscle memory again...I thought Xero were trying for less clicks, not more clicks?

"I created a help ticket for this problem. It seems that their Auto-save feature is causing them problems, which is very frustrating because the auto- save feature is causing a lot of users problems too. Below is the reply I got:

Hi Ross

Thank you for giving access to your organisation.

We understand if the cursor starts with the contact name that would be convenient. In the new invoicing, the cursor doesn't start with the contact name because once you enter the contact name, the invoice will be automatically saved as a draft.


If the other information, such as description, price, quantity have been entered but the contact name hasn't been selected yet, in this case, if users cancel out this page or exit it, this invoice will not be recorded as a draft.

Kelly, I really hope you will be able to get your product team to take this seriously. I believe this will gain quite a bit of support once business owners have time to reach out. I honestly thought it was a mistake (a glitch that would go away). When I was informed that this was intentional and there was no plan to change it back, I was shocked. This is making our day to day operations very difficult. 

Thank you for taking this under serious consideration! I am really trying to be hopeful your team can work quickly on this.",2
I agree its caused errors here to and we just want it back to the Sunday,2
Absolutely agree this should be 'put back to how it was',2
"Unfortunately this has come up again for me also.
as Brandy says, every other piece of software we use starts the week on Sunday, and if it doesn't it has an option in settings to change it.
Invoicing is no ones favorite thing to do, so when you do it you are running on memory and just flicking through it as quick as you can.
Every time the date field comes up in invoices on Xero, my brain registers that it doesn't look right, and distracts me to the point that it makes me stop and look, this is time wasting, and invoicing is NOT billable time for any business other than a bookkeeper.
I was of the impression that putting up with the massive change we just had to the ""New"" Xero, that it was to save us time, which now that I am used to it and some awesome changes have been made, but now we have taken a massive step backwards.
Then once I have done a few hours of Invoicing, I need to put in the Suppliers invoices and it is all different again, are you lot intentionally out to create stress in our lives? Like running a business doesn't already take care of that?

We need more than just putting it to the team, this needs to be either turned back or a selection in settings to have the choice to put it back ourselves.
This needs to happen sooner rather than later.

Please, please, treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves.
Ross.",1
Well said Ross! That is exactly the problem with this change.,2
I agree completely that the inconsistency between calendars is very annoying and has caused problems for us. Please go back to Sunday to Saturday or make everything Monday to Sunday or let us pick what we want.,1
Can someone from Xero please reply?  When can we have a standard Gregorian calendar back?,1
"Surely this should be user configurable? 
I don't want Sunday, that would annoy me greatly. My working week starts Monday.",2

This change wastes loads of my working time as it really confuses me.",1

Setting the calendar to Sunday thru Saturday for everything, including Invoices will benefit data entry as the calendar will be in sync with many other calendars and incorrect dates will no longer be a problem. An even better option to change the first day of the week to any preferred day would be great!",2
"Absolutely DETEST the Monday to Sunday Calendar. The rest of my Calendar world is Sunday to Saturday, and consistency is efficiency! Have had to interrupt my work flow too many times to actually THINK about what is in front of me to ensure it is done correctly. Very Disruptive to experience! If Xero requires a data format for data consistency, that's fine; but, I have a literal picture in mind when dealing with the Calendar and this change is definately a road to data entry errors at this end. Please provide a 'preference' for Calendar presentation or switch back to Sunday to Saturday Calendar presentation thru all of Xero.",1

Preserve real same-day duplicates (like filling up twice at a petrol station or if you pay for coffee twice at the same place throughout the day) and eliminate true feed dupes with full audit.

"A Unit of measure of mm is crucial. And I am pretty sure I know how Xero can cater to the needs of any unit.

You've gotta ask how you measure a unit at the start and for stocktake.

When I get units in, it is in mm, so when it starts, I change a setting from Units of Unit to mm increments, from there I say how many mm I acquire and then between here and stocktake, this is the data that is required for reporting purposes.

When assessing how to track this, ideally you need to know how to accommodate it, and when you know the item and you know the unit, you can see ""Units sold"" and it's 50 units is equal to 50mm based on the Original setting for that item versus say a physical item of a filter which 50 units would be a Unit qty of 50 of these.

Either way, it's 50 and 50, 50 qty of either, but 50 in a different metric of units from Unit to metric milimetres.

I support this feature and unfortunately this will be the achilies heel for my business operations which run on exactly the metric measurement which is difficult to implement without paying $200.00 per month which would wipe out all profits unfortunately.

Doing things harder at this point is working smarter.",1
"Frankly. Zero is NOT for businesses. It's barely a business itself. Do the smart thing and use literally ANY other option. Seriously. 

How is GNUCash able to be more usable for growing businesses than Xero?!?!",0
"Inventory management is a core component of any accounting software—especially for trading or other businesses where goods movement, pricing accuracy, and stock control are vital. However, there is a noticeable gap in Xero’s current inventory and purchasing workflow that impacts internal controls and cost accuracy.

At present, there is no mechanism in Xero that ensures the Storekeeper or Receiver is clearly informed about what exactly is expected to be received as per the Purchase Order. This creates a control issue—the receiving personnel may not have visibility over item descriptions, quantities, or agreed pricing, leaving room for errors, mismatches, or even misuse.

Further compounding the issue is the lack of clarity and integration around units of measure (UOM). An item’s cost can vary significantly based on the UOM used (e.g., carton, box, unit), and if this is not clearly defined in the Purchase Order and matched at the time of receipt, the price comparison and procurement approval process becomes ineffective. This not only undermines cost control but can also lead to accounting discrepancies.",1
Adding units of measure is critical for our business as well.  We can sell a product individually or as a box.  We can also sell the same item from different supplier but their box quantities are different so without the unit of measure the pricing is confusing and off-putting to customers.  we have lost customers or they have delayed payment of invoices as they are querying the price attached to the line item as we are not realising that he box is larger.  It is not good for business.,1
Unfortunately this is a deal breaker for moving from MYOB ... even though we are VERY unhappy with MYOB at the moment (after 30 years),0
"I’d like to request the addition of a ""Unit of Measurement (UOM)"" column in the Invoice module. This feature is essential for businesses that sell goods or services in varying units such as kilograms, liters, meters, boxes, hours, etc.

Currently, we have to manually include the UOM in the item description, which:
- Reduces clarity and consistency across invoices
- Makes reporting and inventory tracking more difficult
- Increases the risk of human error

Suggested Implementation:
- Add a dedicated UOM field in the Products and Services setup
- Display the UOM column in invoices, quotes, and bills
- Allow customization of UOMs (e.g., kg, m², pcs, hrs) per item

Benefits:
- Improved invoice clarity and professionalism
- Better support for inventory-based businesses
- Enhanced integration with third-party apps and reporting tools

This feature would be a valuable enhancement for many users across industries. Thank you for considering this request!",3

"Yes I need this.  I have just queried this being done 
I want to change the file name of the invoice so it sends as ""COMPANY NAME INV-0048"" not ""Invoice INV-0048""

I know how to change the default prefix on an invoice, but that isn't what I want. And I know how to change the default subject line on the email template that accompanies the invoice, but it is the actual name of the electronic PDF file that I want to change as a default. What I mean by that is instead of the PDF file being named ""Invoice INV-0791"" I want it to automatically be called ""COMPANY NAME INV-0781"". As sending supporting supplier invoices to clients/customers/tenants is proving confusing to them when our invoice is called ""Invoice INV-0781"" but where the supporting supplier bill is also generated in Xero is then called ""Invoice INV-36955"". I don't want to have to start downloading to rename everything before attaching to the invoice we want to send. If our default invoice word could just be named directly from Xero, we could continue as we are.  
I am all for working smarter not harder!!",1
"I need this too.  I can only assume that Xero has a team of developers on staff, and if that's the case, is it really that difficult to implement such a simple amendment in the coding to customise the name of the output PDF ?

"Cannot believe such a simple idea to implement, yet you choose not to listen to your customers.

Baffles me.

for example the file name when saving a CIS has clear and precise naming of the document, the customer or supplier and the date all within its file name.

many of the reports are saveable with clear and precise naming of the document.

Our quotes are being sent out as ""Quote-QU-25XXX"", but when you receive them, the ""-"" is being removed, so they are being received as ""QuoteQU25XXX"" works ok with invoices, but not quotes.",1
"To add to the examples already given for where this is needed - I need to send out self bill invoices. I have used the workaround in purchase orders to create these in Xero, but when I send them to the supplier the document is named ""Purchase order...."". This is unprofessional and confusing.

"A Solution for Late Payment Interest and Fees (Including Part-Paid Invoices)

Hi everyone,

I noticed this feature request and wanted to share a tool that could help:  https://stagepay.app/late-fees

StagePay automates the process of applying late fees and interest to invoices, saving you time and ensuring nothing gets missed. Here’s how it tackles the issues mentioned:

Automatic application of late fees and interest—choose between flat fees, percentages, interest rates, or even multiple concurrent late fees and interest charges.

Handles part-paid invoices seamlessly by applying fees or interest only to the remaining unpaid portion.

Customisable notifications and reminders—you can set up automatic emails or messages to notify clients when fees or interest are applied, along with payment reminders.

Custom late fee and interest policies tailored to your business, so you’re always in control of how and when charges are applied.

No monthly subscription cost—StagePay only charges a small transaction fee when your clients make payments by credit card.

Everything happens seamlessly, with notifications sent to your clients as soon as a fee or interest is applied. No need to manually intervene or recreate invoices—it’s all automated and clear.

If this sounds like something that could help, check it out at https://stagepay.app/late-fees

Thanks

John",2

"Xero Team,

I share the frustration of many others! This feature has been available in other platforms for a long time, so we’re all baffled as to why Xero still doesn’t offer this essential functionality.

We need the ability to send invoices to our clients and allow them to pay a deposit to confirm services. Other accounting software even lets us set multiple deposits with specific amounts and due dates—for example:
	•	First deposit: $… due on [date]
	•	Second deposit: $… due on [date]
	•	Balance due: $… on [date]

Come on, Xero—please make this happen!",1
"Xero, please please hear us all! We NEED this feature. It is standard on many other platforms, what gives? Please consider making this update. I'm so close to switching back over to Quickbooks even though it gives me a headache in other ways, having this feature is essential and QB may be the lesser of two headaches.",1
"This is a great Idea, but we should be able to accept the first deposit via the Quote / Estime once its approved (enable a signature via web or mobile once accepted) then create invoies based on the down payment amounts and put on waiting approval to be sent to the client once contract step is completed.",2
"Please Xero, just get this long overdue feature done. We're growing tired of the cumbersome workarounds we have to use just to approximate this feature.",2
When will. you add this feature for such a common way of doing business,2
@Daniel Morris: This is such a basic feature that is common (and helpful) accross many other platforms. I can only conclude that Xero are willfully ignoring developing this feature.,1
Thank you for the feedback. I was wondering what was happening to this following my Zoom call probably almost a year ago. Why is it taking so long? It's such a problem when clients want to part pay an invoice via card.,2
Too little too late for me Xero. The last price rise was the last straw for me - 80% increase over 3 years. Encouraged me to look at the opposition and realise that I could get significantly more features for half the price. Look back over this issue - a clear indication of how a significant feature gap receives so little attention from Xero. Meanwhile the big news is that the main menu is going to be fiddled with yet again. Really! Too much resource spent rearranging deck chairs I would suggest. Bye.,0
Only took you 10 years 🤣,3

We're a certified app partner and I must say this is the most commonly asked questions by our users who have integrated our app with Xero.

"To better support correct service tracking and invoicing, I, like many others here, recommend your development team implement a dedicated date field at the line-item level. Capturing the true date a service is provided is essential for organizations delivering services across multiple days. Relying on the description field for this purpose, as Kelly Munroe suggested, compromises data integrity, reporting, and searchability, especially when sorting across varied client invoices. A static, filterable date field would streamline reporting, i.e., how much of a service item was provided between two specific dates, without using invoice dates as it will not capture correct information, especially when one invoices the following month for services made the previous month. It will also support consistency and significantly improve functionality for users who may depend on detailed service documentation. It’s easier to have the information in one software vs having multiple software databases.

Kelly Munro, on Nov 18, 2024, you stated, “Currently our team are focused on improvements to new invoicing”. With 187 votes already, don’t you believe THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT?",1
"This is a show-stopper for me, previous invoicing software I've used, many different pieces of software, have always had dates for line items - it's virtually essential on monthly/periodic billing for service industries, as the date delivered is a key piece of information.  Including it in the description is completely inappropriate and breaks searchability, as it needs to be accessible via the API or exports as an absolutely key data field of the invoice line.  No Xero for my organisation until this is added.",1
I'll reiterate what many others have said here.  It is really difficult to recommend Xero to a client when it doesn't have some basic functionality that is available in other products,1

"Just adding to the growing frustration here — it's really unacceptable that Xero still doesn't support WET as a standard feature. This isn’t a niche requirement — it’s a legal obligation for businesses in the wine industry, and we shouldn’t have to rely on clunky workarounds or third-party tools to stay compliant.

MYOB has had WET functionality built-in for years, so it's baffling that Xero hasn’t addressed this yet. For a platform that promotes itself as being modern and user-friendly, ignoring something as fundamental as WET doesn’t reflect well.

This needs to be prioritised. It’s not just an inconvenience — it’s a serious limitation for any wine business using Xero.",1
"Having to hack together workarounds adds unnecessary complexity and increases the chance of compliance issues.

I don't want to edit stuff, I just want it to work. This facility should be built in to any serious invoicing system. We are not all online sellers, sending gadgets to consumers, some of us are manufacturers selling to other businesses.",2
"Why is this not a feature already?!
We shouldn't have to run reports to check, go back and fix what should be a feature.",2
Please provide an update on this @Xero - would be a very useful feature to ensure reporting is accurate and complete.,2
"We need to have the option to make tracking categories mandatory, and to what type of transactions. Please update on when this will be available as it is critical to a lot of us here.",2
I have 2 clients who need this option.,2
Staff are currently missing information they are unsure of rather than checking with administration/finance staff.,2
"Can we have an option to make it compulsary for a tracking category to be selected for every item (bills, invoices etc.).  Currently have to periodically search for unassigned items in the nominal and find and recode.",2
Agreed if the tracking categories are in use it should be mandatory to use them for expense claims. It's more frustrating as it is possible to do this in approvalmax when raising POs. Them not being mandatory creates work for finance team when staff omit the relevant department details.,2
amazing functionality and equally amazing that you can't make it mandatory,3
"This is very important for Companies like Construction or Project Accounting where we need to track for profitability reporting and other reports using tracking codes.  Accountant's or users tend to miss or forget to input the tracking codes as you can easily continue when you skipped them.

Hope Xero can add this feature as an Automatic Accounting Instruction, which I know is very easy to program.",2
"We have set up a budget based on Profit Centers, and tracking categories are crucial for our financial management",2
"Making tracking categories mandatory, or at least the option to have them mandatory would be amazing.  Too much time is spent doing housekeeping at the end of the month, where adding the category has been missed!",2
"This feature is needed in Xero, our business has been disappointed and let down by Xero's service, that this feature isn't currently available and much needed. Until this feature is implemented our business cannot use the payment link feature.",1
"Issues relating to credit notes.  

When allocating supplier payments we currently have to allocate credit notes first in the 'pay bills' section before being able to allocate the bank payment to the balance.  This causes issues with the remittance advice that is then sent to the supplier because the credit note is not show separately.  

It also means we have to review aged payables for credit notes before we can allocate bank payments in the bank payment screen.  It would be more helpful if the credit note appeared in the match screen in the bank section and could be included along with the invoices.

It would also be helpful if you could allocate a supplier/customer refund from the bank screen to the relevant credit note.",2

Sadly once that's done you know they are coming to ruin the purchase ledger side of it ..... be careful what you wish for!",0
Is there any update? Where is Xero support??,1
Any update?,1
Is there an ETA on this? A year since it was being implemented (!!!),1
"Can you please update your software to include matching credit notes when matching invoices to bank payments. Having to allocate the credit notes separately is so time consuming and annoying. Please, please update this. This is one thing Sage does so well.",1
Also want batch credit note payments to customers. Same as how we pay accounts payable.,2
"Could you please allow credit notes to apply to the payment instead of to an invoice (payable).  Also if the credit notes are listed on the batch payment print out it would be easier to match invoices paid, credits claimed for the file clerk - ie each invoice/credit note would be listed on the pay stub",2
"Xero when are you going to update us? 

It's been over a year and now I've been notified of another price increase when you can't even offer this basic functionality! It's so incredibly infuriating having to match so many credit notes each month. You're not saving me time, you're costing me time!",0
Please could we get an update?,2
Let's hope that this development will be finished in my lifetime!,1
"It’s been over three years now, from 2022 to 2025, and there’s still no meaningful progress. These are basic, fundamental bookkeeping processes that should have been prioritised long ago. Instead, development efforts seem to be focused on UI tweaks, while the core accounting and compliance functionality continues to lag behind.",1
"Shashish you'll have a long time to wait, I requested this 12+ years ago and am still waiting!",1
"They're VERY busy working on SUPER important updates... like changing the appearance of the invoicing UI for absolutely ZERO benefit to actual bookkeepers... why would they prioritize functionality over making our screens work against us and each tiny function just a little bit slower to make our days in the office more complicated and less efficient?

12 years isn't that long! Can't you see this vital change has been logged as ""in development""? That means they're working on it and we shall just have to wait a little longer, fingers crossed before we're all retired.",1
Could you please allow credit notes to apply to the payment instead of to an invoice (payable).,2
Things like this are basic and need sorting because it makes the job easier!  Most of what has been done recently doesn't!,1
Excellent.,3
We really need this addressed.  It has been over Thirteen years since this feature was asked for!!  It is time to get this feature priortised.,1
Any progress on this? I need to be able to account & reconcile for two invoice payments and a credit in a single transaction and can't see how this is possible unless I do them all individually which then doesn't reflect the actual line in the bank account. So frustrating,1
"Come on Xero.  This is really iimportant.  The credit notes functionality is exceedingly poor compared with other bookkeeping systems.   THIS WAS FIRST REQUESTED IN 2012!!!!  You should not have to allocate a credit note against an invoice which then shows as an underpayment of the invoice on the remittance advice.  You should be able to include a credit note in a batch payment without a silly error message saying ""you can't pay a credit note"".  You should be able to select a credit note along with invoices in the bank reconciliation screen.  Xero have got their priorities all wrong.  Lets sort the basic functionality which affects EVERYBODY before adding bells and whistles that only a few will use.",1
Wow - stop wasting time on look - it’s all about content and functionality,1
In development in March 2024??? As this has been requested pretty much since you started in the UK isn't it about time you dealt with it? No doubt that the developers have NO idea what a hassle it is currently.  For those of us who use Xero on a day by day basis it is such an annoying waste of time. Sage had it perfectly. Time to step up and do some things to help us timewise instead of slow us down.,1
"How hard can it be!

This is a necessity and should have been addressed years ago. Come on Xero, sort it out!",1
"There are so many 'Product Ideas' like this that should be a core feature not something that has to be suggested and chased. All the while prices keep getting hiked and useless AI features are added, but not the basic functions we have been asking for for years.",1
This would save a lot of time,2
"As others have said over the years that this has been ""In Development"", it's a basic / fundamental accounting requirement that should have been included from the launch of Xero, and should have been at the top of the development priority list to add / put right. Instead, Xero continues to focus on adding glossy features that I suspect most users don't actually use or need (AI and analytics for example), and changing the user interface. Come on Xero, listen to your customers and put some effort and focus on getting this and other basic accounting features put right to make Xero more user friendly.",1
"Unfortunately on another feed also regarding the ability to properly use Credit Notes, Xero said they are not even considering this, I've attached a screen shot of the post and my own response to it.

Xero just don't get that this is something that we the end user NEED!",1
I'm so annoyed they've closed off that other thread. Every month I LOATHE having to match 100s of credit notes to random invoices. There must be a simpler way!,1
"Claire, Lisa, Nigel, et al:
Sadly Xero have gone the way of other software companies and put money first.
They must have millions of subscribers by now, because all things considered, it's a far better piece of software than Sage online, the abominable Crapbooks and the laughable FreeAgent.
So, in their confidence that we won't leave them in our droves, they keep putting the price up whilst ignoring our please for basic, fundamental accounting functionality.
In a nutshell, it doesn't matter how many people post on all of the credit note threads (there were a few, because there is an outcry for the software's inability to deal with credit notes correctly), as long as they are still taking our money, they just don't care.
Keep voting, though!",1
"We all need to get onto our Xero account managers (if you can find out who yours is) and lobby them.  I once had a call from a developer in the USA asking about what we wanted.  I replied at length, sent scenarios etc. still nothing.  Maybe I'll lobby the CEO next....",1
"@Patrick James and Co: That's not true for everyone, I stopped recommending Xero in 2018. What does Xero have over Sage, Quickbooks, Freeagent? Nothing.

Sage and Quickbooks are perfectly functional for our larger clients, Freeagent's simplicity is perfect for our micro clients. Xero is a complete non-starter, it's not just these unfulfilled feature requests that are the problem, the UI is horrendous and I hate using it everyday.

The only reason we use Xero at all is for clients who transfer in who have been using it for years.",1
"@Chris Rogers
You're not serious?

FreeAgent has a terrible functionality problem with dealing with Directors Loan Accounts, fixed assets and depreciation and thinks it can calculate Corporation Tax itself, which it can't. It's just not user friendly. It's not simple, it's clunky.

Crapbooks is unusable rubbish that's not fit for purpose.
We have over 75 clients on Xero, 3 remaining on Crapbooks - with many of our clients making the move to Xero in recent years. People are leaving Crapbooks in droves, because it's rubbish. There's no point discussing it further.

Sage Line50 was always the market leader, but when the world moved online, they got left behind and priced themselves out of the market. They have been trying to catch up ever since and Sage Online is not the same product as Sage Line50. They have made improvements in recent years, granted.

Until anything better comes along, Xero is the best value for money - presently - out there.",3
"Oh, I see. We don't use any of them for anything more than bookkeeping, VAT and so on. Accounts/corp tax are done elsewhere. So how Freeagent handles corp tax is irrelevant to us. The rest is just debits/credits, not sure what the problem is?

We're going to have to disagree on everything else as well, but glad to hear Xero is working for you because it never has for us.

The elephant in the room is that Quickbooks, Sage, Freeagent all handle credit note matching better than Xero, pretty much every software does. Also many of these Xero feature requests just aren't a problem elsewhere...",1
"I've spoken to the ""team"" in Reading via my ""Partner Assist Specialist"" and sent in documentation of several scenarios surrounding the functionality of credit notes and how it should work.  They of course can do nothing, but have promised me a call from a ""Senior"".  We'll wait and see.",1
Is there any further update on this.  the last update provided was in March 2024.,2
"Working in a large firm of accountants, transitioning clients to Xero and training them, this is by far my biggest issue with Xero. I have been requesting this for 8+ years now and I can see the request is the most voted for....please, please, please prioritise this!",1
This is SO important - i might need to revert back to Quickbooks as that software does it and i didnt realise sales invoicing would be so hard to do on xero. For a practice that invoices clients contractors costs - but those contractors see my clients books thus process my invoice......there must be something that can be done.,1
Any update on this?  Would be super handy.,2
"Sadly Nathan Xero continue to ignore multiple requests on this preferring ""to focus on other priorities""

They have made it clear that they have no intention of doing anything about this in the near term

Not listening to what the customers need",1
Adding to the chorus - please can we get this in development.,2
HI Xero! Can you give us an update on this? I need this functionality.,2
"Come on Xero, for every person that comments here, there are more that want this feature that don't comment here! This is important to our businesses!!",1
"I'm with everyone on this thread, would love to see this feature added – it’s been requested for years and is something other systems already offer. We often need to track all the individual components for our own records, but don’t always want to show the full breakdown to the client. Being able to combine or hide line items would make things so much tidier and more professional from a customer point of view, while still keeping things clear on the backend.  Please consider prioritising this.",1
"I currently have a free trial, I like the look of xero over competition at present, but This is looking ot be a deal breaker.
We often have 30 or more items on the invoice plus lines for labour costs, we want to be able to describe the service carried out (which can be done in the description field) but not show line items of individual spares or materials, we just need a total for the client.
Pointless paying for email invoicing with payment links if we have to use a seperate invoicing software so the invoices can be sent as we need.",0
"My Thoughts

Reason for Feature Development
1. Professional Presentation for Clients

Many businesses want to present clean, summary-style invoices to clients without exposing detailed internal breakdowns (e.g., markup, subcontractor fees, individual material costs).
Currently, to avoid showing certain line items, businesses must manually merge or delete them, which complicates record keeping and audit trails.
2. Maintain Accurate Internal Reporting

Businesses often use detailed line items for internal analysis, job costing, and tracking. Hiding items from the client-facing invoice while retaining them in the backend would preserve data integrity without compromising client presentation.
3. Competitive Sensitivity

In trades, consulting, and contracting industries, line items may reveal sensitive supplier costs, margins, or proprietary service breakdowns. Hiding them prevents price shopping and protects intellectual property.
4. Industry Standards

Competitor software (e.g., QuickBooks, FreshBooks, and Zoho Books) offer “summary invoices,” “collapsible line items,” or “internal notes only.” To stay competitive, Xero should match this flexibility.
5. Enhanced Customisation and Control

Businesses increasingly demand invoice customisation. Adding this feature would improve user satisfaction, especially among trades, agencies, and firms who need tailored client communication.",1
"I used to need this feature, but I no longer do. I was using Xero as our primary source for customer orders. Now I flipped things around and it's working much better. I am using a separate order management system. It creates an invoice directly in Xero and only includes the information that the customer needs to see. This, I think, is the best of both worlds. The order management system contains all the relevant data to support our SOPs and the invoices in Xero are focused the final products/services that are sold to the customers. This is working better for us rather than overloading the invoices to try to do it all.",2
Put it on your roadmap urgently,2
The inbuilt calculator is not at all helpful to address this issue,1
"Once you have created a custom report, it should be available to display on the dashboard. The reports panel has only a very limited number of reports to choose from. For example I have created a custom report that shows the biggest outstanding invoice balances by contact but I can't display this report (Ideal) nor can I even link to this report (workaround) on the dashboard.",2
Would be helpful if you had the ability to change the dashboard graphs to show YTD as well.,2
"It is top of the UNBELIEVABLY STUPID list that Xero does not have this functionality. 
As the CEO, I don't care about the minutia shown on the current dashboard; I care about:
Financials
Financials
And Financials.",0
This would be very helpful.  Thanks.,2
Would be very useful to personalise the homepage for clients.,2
This feature would save so much time!,2
Really help to make sure approver can quickly approve an invoice rather than waiting for them to log on and check through all invoices,2
"Would save so much time and errors if implemented, yes please",2
Also find a way to turn off expense notifications for the rest of us who have absolutely nothing to do with expense claims but get a notification every times one is uploaded,2
"The lack of this feature alone is enough to consider an alternative software package.

The idea that managers need to hunt down invoices requiring their approval by logging in multiple times per day / week, particularly around month end, to see if anything is there for them is quite frankly ridiculous and a waste of managers time.",0
This is really needed .,2
"Very often we missed the bills and invoices. It requires to be in Xero for me to be able to process pending bills. I’m always on the go (travel), notifications would be awesome and will speed up our  process and at the end our client will be happy 

Looking forward for some thing great to happen with Xero 
We love Xero. Come on team !",3
This would be very helpful,2
"Isn't this a basic requirement for a purchase order system? Some people can raise them, others can approve them and people get notified as and when they've got something to do?

Choosing an approver for a PO should either be mandatory when creating it, or defined by configuration, ie. Mrs A approves POs raised by Mr B.

When Mr B raises a PO, Mrs A is notified. When Mrs A approves / declines the PO, Mr B is notified and everything moves along nicely.

Surprised to find that you're 3 years in to this suggestion with no apparent progress.",1
"Couldn't agree more,  we raised this and commented about it a number of times.   Im now face with the proposition that we must have approvers in the process,  so looks like we may have out grown Xero, finally and will need to move to something more capable as a business tool.

Sorry Xero,  it was good while it lasted,   maybe losing customers to a competitor might finally spur you into listening to your customer base more.",0
"Totally support this request, will create faster more efficient processing",2
"I'm just here to second all the requests for bill/invoice approval notifications that have already been made. Come on Xero, this is a basic feature that many businesses need - having to manually check whether something is awaiting payment is so clunky!",1
This feature would streamline our billing in a significant way,2
"In an office where the FD (our approver) is snowed under with work, they often forget to approve things. Regular reminders would be so beneficial to our business when things need approving.",2
This feature would be a game changer!,2
A brilliant idea but sad to see that nothing has been done in 13 years,1
It's unbelievable this is not already done!!!,1
How has this not already been implemented..I'm having issues with getting things done without this notification that when I read online supposedly is available but clearly is not,1
"@Alex McDonald, why is this not a feature that is already on Xero? Why should we need to attach an app and have the extra expense of this? 

There are so many people asking for this now, come on Xero! 😡",1
Really. This isn't a feature??? What? I would have thought it is a very basic feature. Allow lower-ranking staff to create invoices and send them for approval. Notifying higher-ranking staff that they have an invoice waiting to be approved.,1
"I am really surprised there are not notifications to approvers when an invoice awaits approval. It means someone has to contact me outside the system, then I go into Xero to look for it, then go back out to let the person know I approved it. I expected the feature to exist.",1
"A notification feature for invoices needing approval is a must for me, very disappointing this feature isn't just standard practice. feels basic.",1
any updates on this? looks like the request has been sitting for over 3 years. :?,2
"I also have several suppliers that offer a discount, but currently have to manually calculate each invoice.   I would also like to see a credit limit and discount % section within the supplier details.  They are there for AR but not AP",2
Very disappointing response. Same old same old. Clearly Xero doesn't care about existing customers. - John Rae,1
"Just asked the same question today. I have an statement with multiple lines getting discounts, so now I'll have to amend each one individually. What a pain.",1
Whilst I continue to use Xero I do not recommend it to others. In fact I disrecommend it. Customer focus and response is very poor. This particular topic has dragged on for years. The lack of action by Xero show how out of touch their senior management is from customers of their in the field.,0
This is a standard feature in most other software.  Not sure why Xero cannot handle early pay discounts.,1
"Hi, please if you can we really need discount applied to accounts payable, as we have alot of suppliers that offer discount to us. I would be so nice to be able to do it on bills level and not have to capture credit notes each time. It can be time consuming. Please this is one feature that is missing from Xero, I am a new user to Xero we use to use pastel, they had that feature. We are really missing it. Thanks",1
"Hi, thank you for your reply, total understand. Please if you guys can push it up to the front of the quey. It is quite time consuming, to have to go do a credit note each time for the discount on a suppliers, one suggestion is that when we were doing the payment in the bank recon, we could apply the discount there as well. which is quite nice too. This is the only feature that i have found missing in Xero, otherwise all is good so far. Shirene",2
Very frustrating. This has been dragging on for years.,1
Super frustrating that this was suggested 13 years ago and it hasn't been improved in that time. I'm wasting so much time adding a discount line to nearly 100 bills a week.,1
"Implementing an early settlement discount feature would be a significant improvement for our company. Most of our suppliers offer these discounts, so the ability to post a discount with each invoice—subject to a specific payment date—would be ideal.

Specifically, we are looking for a system that automatically applies the discount to invoices paid within the qualifying window during bulk payments, while defaulting to the full invoice amount for those that fall outside that timeframe.

This functionality would greatly enhance our efficiency. Could you please let me know if this is something that can be supported?",2
I've lost track of the time wasted jumping between organisations...,1
Extremely critical to my organization to be able to do this,2
This would be an incredibly useful feature. Please consider!,2
"Not having the ability to add subtotals to quotes and invoices in Xero is one of the biggest regrets that I have in moving from Quickbooks to Xero. Overall I do like Xero, but not having the ability to add subtotals seems like an obvious misfire on Xero's part. For as long as I have been using Xero (nearly 10 years now) the community has been asking for this feature but Xero has looked the other way.",1
Please Please Please add sub totals to invoicing. Very important in the quoting process to allow clients to see each section clearly,2
"The over whelming support in favor of sub totals is staggering. 

id also like it as well would help with a massive contractor that we work with",2
It's gobsmacking that we can do anything we want with AI but accounting software can't sub-total an invoice. What a basic accounting principle so tragically overlooked.,1
I am trying to convince one of my companies to transfer from QBO to Xero. As this is crucial to our invoicing this may be a big stumbling block. The amount of invoicing we do in a day makes it unfeasible to export to PDF and edit each one. Please let me know if there is any movement on this.,2
Can't believe in 2025 we are still waiting on this. We are paying for a platform to manage our invoicing and the solution is to use a different platform to manage our invoicing?,1
We're trying to switch from QuickBooks and this is a huge hurdle for us.,1
"As a new user of Xero, I'm surprised that what I thought would be a standard feature of accounting software isn't available; yet the issue has been highlighted by so many people, over many years. Surely something so simple could be added, considering how much the monthly fee increases year-on-year.",1
"Just moved from quickbooks due to accountant requirements and incredibly disappointed this isn't available out of the box. 
PLEASE fix this",1
"Sub-totals are a must in invoicing software and should be standard - not a third party add on that adds to the overall cost.  Competitors (Quickbooks, MYOB etc) have this nailed and it is extremely disappointing to have to add MANUAL sub totals to invoices (with the inherent errors that will occur).  No matter what industry you are in sub-totals in invoices is a MUST.",1
"Chiming in to say that not having subtotal ability is what will make me jump ship with Xero. I am definitely feeling the pain from transitioning away from Quickbooks, and this may be the deal breaker. The add-ons and the subscriptions to make simple things work are hard to take.",0
"this.... has been going on forever. if it wasn't for xero's integration with my local banks and accounting firms, i'd gladly stick with quickbooks. unfortunately quickbooks doesn't have enough integration with my local vendors.

"As Hannah G (Admin, Xero) stated, Xero is a ""global product"". Therefore small business owners (in NZ) are not a priority. I notice it says the ""Xero Team (Admin, Xero) shared this idea Sep 2, 2012"" Is that correct, 13 years ago! There is probably an ideas threshold flag of >1000 & with only 305 votes this is going nowhere fast. Sad, but welcome to the world of being ignored by a huge corporate.",1
The Xero TV advert should be reported as misleading.  The guy gets into quick sand but no way does Xero resolve our needs. . . . I've found another accountant who embraces Quickbooks. . . Time for me to leave.,0
"A word tothe XERO team.
This is madness.
Whilst you continue to invest in useless updates, you ignore such basic needs.  This is a very simple update for you guys with less regression testing required than you woudl need for many of the useless changes you have made recently.

Purely because of this issue, XERO is of no use to us in most applications.

There is an obvious missunderstanding by those wiuthin XERO as to how important this feature is...not just because people like it but ecause some products HAVE to be quoted like this and invoiced like this.

At teh earliest opportunity, we shall be migrating our busines to another system.  We also always recommend people DO NOT use XERO now as it is proven that some most basic features are not in place.

Of course, XERO know how difficult it is for a business to migrate and take advantage of this through subscription changes, feature dilution, etc etc.  They will put up with customers not getting basic features as long as customers still pay.

This WILL change XERO.  You will lose customers as word of mouth changes from 'its a great system' to avoid XERO, they dont offer basic features and dont respond to customers needs'

I learned of XERO through a very large global group of fast growing businesses that I am part of.  This group is backed by one of the worlds largest and most influential global companies.  XERO was the defacto choice for many and recommended to nearly all.
I can tell you now that it is already changing.   Many now recommend your competitors who have a more complete solution, have moved forward faster and are better value.",0
"For a global provider to not fast track such a basic feature is third world - don't suggest work arounds, Xero was championed as the best there is ... all in one place .... at your fingertips solution.
Our suppliers are expecting more detail and breakdowns as they micro-manage costs.
Come on Xero - DO BETTER!",1
"I also require sub totals on invoices, it is a customer request/requirement going forward.

Please advise something is being actioned seems a poor out come considering the time this was first raised requested.",2

That conversation between us — that's how we get better together.""- don't have the statement as waffle and fluff in a feel good end of year blanket email Sukhinder Singh Cassidy.  Make it real.  With all the ""You told us you wanted smarter tools that actually save time"" and ""This year, we shipped a lot of new capabilities in response"" fluffy, feel good words in the email 20/12/2025 I would expect ACTION on getting sub-total ability in to the invoicing capability - pronto!!!",1
"Will it possible to have a sending date that is before the posting date of the invoice? The invoice needs to be sent on the 25th of the month, but the posting date needs to be the 1st of the next month. For example: The invoice needs to be sent out on 25 March but the posting date will be 1 April.",2
"Revenue Recognition and amortizing Prepaid Expenses is pretty much the same type of calculation that Xero is already able to do in the Fixed Assets module for Depreciation. A module is a much better option than for us to book repeating MJEs out for 12 months or tracking on a worksheet outside of the system. 

Seems like low hanging fruit to build and make almost all accountants : ) 

That would save us a lot more time than whatever enhancements were made on invoicing and reporting over these past years.",2
Agree! Is there a way to expand the Fixed Assets module to have the initial entry hit a liability account through invoicing and then amortize each month?,2
it would be helpful to have two reference boxes when posting a bill. One for the bill invoice reference number and one for the companies reference if you use reference numbers which my company does.,2
All other systems can record 2 reference numbers. Our reference number so that we can locate the item and the supplier reference number.  Ridiculous that only one reference field is available.,1
"Hi,

Could we have another box next to reference in suppliers invoices for purchase orders, as the moment we are using reference for invoice number and adding the PO details in the description which i would prefer to keep for what the purchase was.",2
"Please add this feature, it is now long outstanding and we need second reference option in the bill.",2
Please add this in - I need to be able to search for things using 2 different references!,2
We would like this added in too. We use our own references i.e 1st invoice in May is MAY001,2
"It has actually been over 10 years since this feature was requested. No update as to when this could be added and suggests that no development has been done in Bills for a long time as it could easily be incorporated into an update. It is standard practice for Purchase Order reference to be linked to a bill, but Xero expects this to be added into the line detail. This is a very backward approach for a forward thinking company. It may seem trivial, but if you are dealing with this for hundreds of bills a week/month, the benefits of Xero start to get outweighed by the daily functionality of other options.",1
Please please can this 2nd reference field be added to Bills soon! Duplicate payments have been made because of this oversight. 10 years of asking and counting.... please....,1
"I have been using Xero since March 2010, and have been waiting 15 years for this second reference.  You bring out all these wonderful ""improvements"" but no second reference field.
I too have made duplicate payments because of this problem.
Why have you not added this small feature, you've had it for sales invoices since day one.  No brainer.  Come on Xero, get it sorted.  I am sick of waiting.",1
Please see attached email detailing how SAGE invoicing is better as it has more fields. Had we understood the Xero limitations here we may not have moved to Xero. There are a lot of other users asking for more invoice fields. This would be a great enhancement.,1

"Please consider adding an additional reference field to both bills and invoicing - this would be really useful. The attached shows the difficulty we are having with this when compared to SAGE, who's software currently allows for this much more effectively. If this could be added, it would be much appreciated and would greatly improve our Xero experience.",1
In desperate need of more than 1 reference field on bills.  Fields must be searchable within Xero as well,2
"Been waiting 15 years for this.  In that time, Xero have brought in plenty of upgrades, but not this one simple feature.  Come on Xero, get your act together.  Having this reference as a search field is an excellent idea.
Sales Invoices have always had this, why not Bills.",1
"This would be a very valuable feature for our business. Many clients ask us how to make part payments through Xero payment services, however they are not able to. 
It is 12 years since you shared this idea (in 2012) and I am surprised Xero does not have the resources to make this feature active by now...I am not impressed with Xero since I have started using it 6 months ago.",1
"Ability to issue progress payments on quotes /invoices to percentage claim certain items or expenses.

Progress Payments on a invoice is critical to my business .


i was shocked when i realise that xero didn't have the ability to do this",1
"This is something we truly need, our work is fixed price, we send progress invoices as the work/project is being done",2
we are offering payments over 12 months / Biannual and would like the ability to add multiple due dates so the invoices age correctly.,2
"Please our company really needs this for our invoicing.  We are constantly having to send separate invoices and deducting all the other invoice amounts so that they are left with a total amount owing.  

it is time consuming.  PLEASE CAN THIS BE LOOKED AT URGENTLY",1
"Our company needs this option as our quotes or purchases orders from clients comes with different stages on it. The time between stages can be 1 or 2 months, so invoice client as soon as one stage is completed is an alternative that Xero's should offer in the sofware.",2
"This is an absolute critical functionality, and I believe would be for many businesses. It's a shame that currently due to gap of Xero not capable to offer it many organizations would have to look into 3rd party tools probably forcing then to move away from Xero.",1
"Can all those here who really would benefit from this idea, bombard this page with this request so maybe then XERO will take some action! You would think this isn't such a difficult feature to add to the system with other systems having had implemented this a while ago... 

XERO we want to be able to do progress payments, please do something about it. Thanks",1
Our business really needs this as we have ongoing projects and need to be able to track against full quotes.  Seems that each time I want to automate something in Xero it requires an additional add on which costs more money.  We simply can't afford to keep paying monthly fees.,1
"This is definitely a critical function for the most of sole traders, don't understand why you guys haven't been designed it yet.",1
Needed for invoiving of instalment statements for debtors,2
This would be a great function for our rent invoices where customers do not want to receive a rent invoice every month.,2
"Our client has just started using Xero projects and needs to issue progress invoices on fixed price contracts.  We also want progress invoices to be posited to a liability account for customer deposits and the final invoice to show the full contract price posted to sales less the progress payments posted to customer deposits.  I can override the figrues in the final project invoice but the project profitability summary then displays incorrectly. 

Please add progress invoicing to projects.",2
I have a number of Clients that this would be useful for.  They like to issue the full invoice but want to be able to set payment due dates for the instalments,2
"We are often looking to produce progress payment invoices based off the total quoted/accepted amount. Each progress payment invoice should then detail any amounts received against the total amount, as well as invoicing for the next amount due and in effect, give a running balance. Seems crazy that this is not something Xero have considered. Please product team, investigate this option as I'm sure plenty of people would benefit from this feature.",1
Yes please make this happen ASAp. We would love the freedom of our customers being able to pay as much as they want on their Invoice with Xero keeping track. Having them only able to make the Full Payment does not always work for each customer as we are dealing with large amounts and not all credit cards allow large amounts. So they sometimes pay in multiple instalments. PLEASE GET THIS ACTIVE,1
"This would be super helpful for our business as well. Our terms are broken up to in 3 payments 30% deposity, 30% at installation and 40% at completion.",2
Is there an update on this please?,2
"Yes, update please. This function is a must for those of us who have customers/clients who are required to pay multiple invoices at once. Can we please get this function added ASAP.",2
any news on this option to add Pay Now link to the statements please ?,2
"I can't believe I've just stumbled across this as a feature that doesn't already exist. 

In my view it's very primative that with xero you can't add a link to 'pay now' when sending statement e-mails. It is 2025.. this should be already available... come on xero developers, please get this enacted. There's businesses like ours setting up direct debits for customers, growing sending an ever increasing number of invoices, team Xero should be treating this as a priority. 

Competitiors already do this?! Although I suppose if it's left long enough, enough folk will start looking elsewhere for accountancy programmes and there won't be a need for this anymore!",1
"This is a really basic omission which, having just switched to Xero, I'm really frustrated about.  I hope it gets added very soon.",1
This has been ongoing for some time. What sort of timescale are we talking Xero.,1
It doesn’t make sense that there isn’t yet available. Please fast track.,1
This feature would help immensely with cash flow,2
This is a must release feature in my opinion,1
We are a school using Xero we invoice annually and parents can pay monthly so it is really necessary for the online payment method to be linked to statements as well. Doesn't make sense that this is still unavailable.,1
"I have discovered that there is now a ""Review and Pay"" button on statements.

It will only appear if the invoice is new. I have found that you can prompt it to show in older statements by ""editing"" an invoice. You don't need to edit anything, you just need to make Xero think you have edited the invoice.",2
YES! FINALLY!!!! I have been using my own custom made template for this for ages - seems crazy to send a client a statement with 10+ outstanding invoices on it and expect them to open each invoice and click the links separately...! this pay now feature is well overdue. thank you Xero! I am v sad I didn't get to try it out though... hopefully in the next pool??!,4
"This is critical for Bpay payments to one supplier - the transaction is input as one invoice, but the Bpay payments are paid individually, meaning sometimes there is 40+ transactions to match off to one invoice. This takes a significant amount of time!",1
"It is unbelievably disappointing that Xero does not have a way to BULK reconcile many statement lines with one transaction or one invoice.

It is a huge stain in the ability of Xero to serve our needs.

Within cash coding tab, there should be a ""Find & Match"" button that applies to ALL the selected rows and does the equivalent of ""Split"" when doing one by one.

I can't believe this issue has been lingering for YEARS. 
It's probably half a day of coding for an intern. This is outrageous.

We are considering switching solution just because of that, and I will slash all my online reviews of Xero until this is fixed.",0
The years are rolling by and not only has it not been done.  There is also no response.  I’m looking to leave on this.  Plus the increases in costs and forced backwards functionality.,0
"My complaint was posted 2 years ago.  No reply, multiple other people with the same complaint and nothing done about it so we are now moving to SAGE.",0
Need to also be able to send one receipt for multiple payments for one invoice,2

I currently have 6 entities with you and if this doesn't become a feature soon I will have to leave you guys for a better tool.",1
"This is critical for property managers and developers that have hundreds of properties, as well as setting up Bpay batches. Why is this request continuously ignored?",1
God that we waste time associating those paiements by hand by splitting and splitting and splitting the invoice 😫😫 please give us an extra tool for this!!,1
"I think that a lot of feature development seems to favour accountants and larger businesses.

This is one that would help smaller firms where bookkeeping is done in house and  where time is very precious.

Xero, please look at this feature.",1
"Why is this not a thing? If you can match multiple invoices to one payment, why on earth is it not an option to do the same in reverse? Surely it's not a hard thing to code the software to do? Or is it not pretty enough for Xero to care about?",1
i eagerly await this feature to be developed. It will really save so much time. thanks,2
This would be great to have for the farming clients to be able to have a proper livestock trading account.  I've recently viewed the video on how to set up the livestock trading account which refers to a spreadsheet to do this calculation but the link doesn't work and i have now been told this has been discontinued!!! Very frustrating,1
"Seems like everyone's on the same page as me, but Xero just don't care.",1
"What ****** me off, is that Xero will have the audacity to send a questionnaire to ask for ideas or to find out how wonderful they are. I simply won't waste my time answering them. They have the information they need in their forum.",0
We urgently need this feature for our export documents.,2
"XERO PLEASE ACT UPON IT !
Everyone needs this features badly !",1
"Using a line item for a comment or description by not assigning a quantity or price works fine on the pdf version of the invoice. However, on the invoice summary in the body of an emailed invoice a 0.00 value is shown for the comment or description. As I said, this zero value doesn't show on the pdf, but I think it looks strange showing up in the email.",2
"I'm just switching over from kashflow and whilst lots of things about Xero are better, it's a bit dumb not to have the basic function of adding a comment line to an invoice!",1
Other accounting software have this feature.,1
"This was idea was submitted 2012.

THIRTEEN YEARS AGO.

As a programmer, I understand why this has not been implemented, as it's extremely difficult to change the format of the line in the table (especially with custom .docx files) to have either a full line that stretches across the table (merging all the cells) or a standard line with all the individual details.

So here's an idea.

1. The advanced templates will have two table rows in the items loop:
  1.1 The first defines the table row design of a comment
  1.2 The second defines the table row design of an itemised line

2. The PDF creator will choose to use:
  2.1 The comment line format if the item quantity is empty or has a value of 0 (zero)
  2.2 The itemised line format if it's not zero.

I don't even want to be paid for this idea.
But I know it's doable and not too hard to implement, if you've written your code well.

So, get it done and see the kudos flow in.",1
"Unfortunately, you are not even able to open a screen for each company at the same time unless you do this in different web browsers.

AR, AP and general business analytics. We spend more time to export and consolidate outside of Xero, while all the helpful business snapshot reports are only available individual. Individual reports are not accurate as transactions occurs across entities",2
Consolidation reporting for a group entities is needed.,2
Why can xero not include this functionality.,1
"This is urgently required. We need to be able to provide Profit and Loss reports for individual divisions and then bring the profit /loss into a Combined Profit and Loss Report for head office. This is a basic accounting software reporting requirement, all other accounting programs that I have worked with provide this capability. Please make this high priority to fix, we shouldn't have to be fiddling around creating excel reports, etc.
Same goes for Xero still not having proper farming reports.",1
Really would like Xero to respond to this query as it's been on the table for sooo long with no response or timeline for fix,1
what about letting us to export all the company TB at one go or PL or BS at one click of button,2
This is very important to me - would also assist with lodging consolidated BAS which  I do know but have to manually consolidate,2
"is there anyone using any of the Xero recommeded apps for this purpose? 

Would apprecaite if there is any feedback about any of the apps available fo this purpose. Thanks!",2
"I've just received the notice that there is yet another app compatible with xero that will do this.

What has been asked for is a basic function as are many requests, yet xero palm them off to outside apps that we need to pay for as add ons.

Why don't xero  just do the work that is and has been available in MYOB for some time?",1
"This is a sad news actually. Anyway, for those who are looking for another platform to consolidate reports from Xero, we are currently using QuickConsols. It helps as it can be integrated to Xero and forward balances from Xero automatically and can be set up in a way that all organization will have the same GL outline for consolidated FS. However, you still need to work-out other things through excel. Hopefully, Xero will take more enthusiasm in adding this feature so it would be easier for us to do consolidated FS.",1
"That really is a shame as from an IT technical point of view it ain't so difficult.  The challenge - as always is actually having users maintain group disciplines - common chart of accounts, and standard  intercompany account codes for P&L and balance sheet. Commercially it would take xero into a whole new world of clients - so it seems more than daft not to pursue this",1

Notwithstanding your additional commentary, I dont understand the reason but I do see the corporate speak.",1
agree with others this should be a function so as to not have to reconcile the receipts manually again,2

This would be a huge time saver,2
"It's ridiculous that you can't edit a bank account - if the transaction is unreconciled, which it will be if it's been posted to the wrong bank account, why not be able to edit the bank account to the correct one? A huge amount of time and possibly error in redoing the transaction, especially if already allocated to an invoice",1
This has been in the ideas bank for 3 years!  It's critical to be able to change the bank account for unreconciled transactions.  It's such a time waster if a receipt is submitted as paid from the wrong credit card or account!  The only fix ATM is to delete the transaction and re-enter it!,1
"PULEEZE! Bank transfer to the wrong account, as an example. Need to be able to edit the transfer. Having to delete and start over is a recipe for errors. In my case, it's an erroneous transfer from a square bank feed, so no idea if deleting that will mess OTHER things up!",1
"Yes, please add this functionality.  My business has more than one credit card. Expenses are sometimes entered under the wrong credit card. During reconciliation, it would be nice if the bank account could simply be updated instead of having to delete and re-enter the expense. Better yet, your software should be smart enough (in the reconcile screen) to recognize that the transaction was entered under a different account and suggest the correction.",1
"Please give this priority, thank you.",2
"This should be a standard feature, like it is in myob & other accounting software programs. 
It may seem a minor feature to Xero, but it can be a big time saver when reconciling & processing in multiple bank accounts.",1
"This would be a well received, very useful, practical improvement that would be helpful on a daily basis.",2
Being able to change the bank account the transaction has been posted to should be standard. You've been able to do this since way back when desktop accounting software were main stream. Having to delete a transaction and remove the document attachment and start again is not beautiful.,1
It would really benefit if being able to add a custom field to sales invoices as our business need to write in the progress claim %. for easy reference. It is a mess if everything put at the description column.,2
"Add additional customisable reference fields to invoices. Other softwares allow this.

"So disapppointing that this feature is still not on the roadmap, 13 years later.

Requested in 2012
Pages and pages of responses from people saying they need it

We often have to resort to creating invoices in spreadsheets again on complex jobs or filling in extra lines in the invoice to explain the cost breakdowns. This takes time, increases chance of errors and reduces readability for the client.

I read the ""building on beautiful"" link that a community manager posted here as a pinned response (at the time of writing)

In my case, I hire equipment for events, it's important to know not just the quantity of items, but how many days they're being used for. I'd also love to have subtotals for different areas we're working on. (whether different stages, or dividing up labour, equipment, transport etc).

Custom fields could meet all of the goals of building on beautiful, building simplicity, innovation and accessibility. It's a far more accessible, readable and useful to allow custom fields in an invoice that suit the needs of the client and business rather than the awful workarounds often required.

As it stands, it's a weak and partially implemented solution and without drastic changes, I know it could be so much better.",1
"ATTENTION XERO!
Referring to Andrew Waugh's comment posted today, and so many others like it, it seems that you are not interested in adding the basic features which so many customers have been requesting for many many years.
There is nothing beautiful about your lack of interest in implementing the basics which other far cheaper packages supply.",1
"Having heard back from The Xero specialist today, I have to fully agree with Penny O’Toole and Andrew Waugh that Xero don’t seem to care about what the end user actually requires, the suggested work around is what I’m already doing and it frustrates me to no end as well as being time consuming

So my work around is to look at another provider

We aren't able to assign a person to this product idea as each idea needs to be approved by our internal teams that work on new functions to Xero. The best suggestion I can make is to leave your comments and vote on that product idea since our product team continually review this page for suggestions on our upcoming changes to Xero.

As far as I can see the last time Xero commented on this product was almost 2 years ago… monitor it .. I call BS",1
I totally support this. We always use the description field to add some notes and specific T&Cs which makes the invoice format looks really bad,2
"Since this idea was raised 13 years ago and there has been no comment about it from Xero for years making it clear they don't care for this idea, does anyone know of an alternative that has this function?",1
"How is Xero so far behind here?  I can't enter a PO number, a delivery address, an ""attention to"" name unique to each invoice.  It seems like such a simple thing to do and I was surprised I couldn't find it anywhere.  Thought I was going crazy.

Not only can Xero not do it, but it appears they have no intention on getting it up and running.  ""New Invoicing"" Pffft!  What a waste of time.

I know which software I will be referring clients back to.  At least then they can do what they need and I don't have to listen to all the complaints.",0
We need dates! Wake up XERO,1
We need specifc area's for reference numbers,2
We need to be able to add another box to add another reference on the invoices,2
Mind boggling that this feature exists for Quotes in Xero but not for Invoices...,1
"Restricting manipulation and ultimately usefulness of xero data - get the option of adding a custom field on both invoices and bills please. I can't understand why for instance ""Order Number' is a customer field on Purchase Orders and doesn't follow through into Bills for instance. Come on, only a little adjustment - your stock is up 6%",1
"NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

Kelly
This function is CRITICAL if we are to get VALUE out of XERO.  We have Customers that need additional information, which can't be replicated in XERO from CIN7 due to XERO not having the option of ADDITIONAL FIELDS.
If we could, we would be able to MAXIMISE the function of AUTO REMINDERS for certain Customers.  Our staff waste time resending unpaid invoices.  
This function SHOULD ALREADY be in XERO.  Other accounting software have it.

Also you said that there was not likely to be any action for the next 12 months.  That was back in March 2023.  So it's now 2 years later.

Have XERO put this on the agenda yet?

If not, who do I need to talk to explain how important this function is.  As a share holder, it ****** me off that XERO is not listening to their Customers (even though Xero is making money for me).  To continue to focus on making money is a rather short sighted strategy as once you have Customers leave they will not come back.
I hope that the team making the call on what gets prioritised are not TECHNICAL PEOPLE or MARKETING PEOPLE but people with REAL BUSINESS knowledge",0
"Seeking this functionality as our CRM has multiple reference fields available that we need to use, however when we export invoices to Xero there is only the one reference field. We desperately need multiple reference fields on Xero invoices to properly integrate and invoice providers who require more information. We don't have time to manually manipulate invoices when we have 1300 clients to invoice every month end. Xero, please listen to your paying customers and create more flexible invoicing options.",1
"Sad to see that this was raised 2 years ago now and still not being considered. 
The notes function that was mentioned is helpful and all, but we cannot search for the contents of these notes to quickly see who has/hasn't signed up to something or who owns a specific item we need more information for.
The amount of time at month end and beyond that would be saved is what makes this very important for us

May we have an update as to if/when this may be considered? You can add custom fields for reports and orders, so why not for contacts and invoices?",1
"Because I can't create an invoice that calculates quantity, price, and number of months (custom field), I have to create invoices manually for some services. Xero seemed like a great application, but the more I learn, the more disappointing it is to see that adding a custom field to the invoice is not on the roadmap in 2025.",1
"Now 13 years later, this is still not implemented.  Xero must have the resources to fix this.  It is quite normal for invoiced to include a date delivered column.  This should be simple to implement and useful for a a lot of customers.  Please don't succumb to inshitification now that you have captured the market...",1
Xero allows us to connect with so many apps - it would be great to have a couple of custom fields to allow us to i) keep records among different aps that relate to a specific customer and 2) allow us to add merged fields from a connected app.,3

"I am converting from Reckon to Xero and paid and just realised that there is no column on the invoice to add a service date.  We have the majority of our commercial cleaning business customers on a monthly single invoice that require several service dates within that month.  Just realised that this is not possible.
Extremely disappointed as heard the Xero was the Rolls Royce in business programs.",1
"Hello,
I had multiple clients asking for convenience fee addition to the invoice and had to disappoint them.
I suggest to implement a change to accommodate a convenience fee that is applied when clients pay via credit card, as opposed to account balance payments.

The key requirement is to have this convenience fee calculated as a percentage of the total invoice amount and displayed as a separate line item at the bottom of the invoice in Xero.

For example, an invoice would look like this:

Services A $100.00
Services B $100.00
-----------------------------
SUBTOTAL $200.00
CONVENIENCE FEE 3.5% $7.00
-----------------------------
GRAND TOTAL $207.00

Thank you",2
"We have government clients who are asking to be sent invoices using the eInvoicing function, rather than pdf's via Xero's email function, BUT they also require a separate field to be added to the invoice header so that their system can recognise the invoice.
Without a custom field on the invoice header, we are unable to comply as we already use the Reference field for internal purposes. If we could add an internal reference field that can be seen on the Contact card in the same way the Reference field currently does, that would solve the issue.",1
"@ Xero, this is a VERY basic function that your customers are requesting. Not having this function impacts on our ability to service OUR customers, and it makes us look incompetent. We are tired of having to provide our customer with the excuse, ""Our accounting software doesn't have that function"". This basic function has been available with Quickbooks Online for over 12 years. I personally regret switching to XERO at the suggestion of my accountant. XERO is clearly tailored to meet the needs of accountants and is completely out-of-touch with the needs of it's end-users. I'm so sick of this ****. I want to go back to Quickbooks.",0
"I am new to Xero. I thought the accounting side of the program is far more robust and “accounting like” than QuickBooks could ever imagine being. However, QuickBooks is a lot more flexible and adaptive when it comes to form customization. I am very disappointed that there is not a “service date” field, none customizable, and, apparently, based on Kelly Munro’s comments, nothing on the table. It seems that the “building on beautiful” with its “the only constant is change,” the notion that Xero has to stay ahead of its competition, etc., is nothing more than “building on beautiful” is more lip service than customer service. What a shame!!",1
"Wow - this request was created in 2012!

We use XERO for two businesses and run a SaaS business for school management software and quite often find ourselves in the position of recommending accounting software.

It's fast getting to the point we will have to move away from XERO as the lack of a few custom/merge fields on the contact record causes us a *lot* of manual copying and pasting for each billing invoice we send.

I think XERO is missing a beat here.

Why not add a few fixed text fields (e.g. Custom 1 Text, Custom 2 Text) to the customer record and have them as merge fields in the email or document templates?

This would vastly improve things and I can't imagine this is very difficult to do.",1
"Yes, we can add extra details in the reference field on an invoice, but that's not adequate.  You can't search for this information via the customer search option which means trawling through every invoice trying to find the one you are looking for. Extremely limited functionality in Xero regards setting out documents . This is a very disappointing part of the programme.",1
"Man... the invoicing system is still lagging
Please consider giving us extra fields

I need an extra quantity column, so I have number of units hired and number of days.

And subtotals for different categories of items. 

We currently resort back to spreadsheets on big jobs, but they're cumbersome and more prone to mistakes.

I'm considering a 3rd party program that can integrate with Xero, basically just for this feature, But it's doubling what I pay per month..",1
"Another vote for extra fields, not that it seems you needs more votes for this, you have enough. Its a very basic request guys?!",1
It really appears that Xero doesn't care what their users think. Even that pathetic accounting software QuickBooks offered flexibility where Xero seems to snub their clientele. I am newer to Xero and only here because of our new accounting firm. Not impressed so far.,1
"As it has now been over 2 years since the last admin response, could we please have another? 
In Mar23 it was said to not be planned in the following 12 months, it has been 29 months, so is there a plan at all to address this?

We have also realised that the 'reference' on the sales invoice isn't actually included on the invoice itself when sent, I am unable to find an option to do this. So the 1 option we had is actually not an option

Now we resort to changing the customer's account number to include multiple bits of info, as that is actually shown on invoices, but makes it look very complicated and unprofessional",1
Any progress on Custom fields? Currently in my 30day trial - system is great apart from the inability to display further information for the customer on the invoice and this may well prevent me from purchasing a plan! Having to use a different platform to give customer details of work carried out as well as advisories is not only time consuming but there is room for the customer to claim they did not receive it whereas if it is part of the invoice then if invoice is paid there is proof that they received the information.  It has been a very surprising disappointment that Xero do not offer this function and seem very reluctant to do so!!!,1
"I totally agree.  It's something that should be standard -  I also need to add further details about a customer on invoices,  and  there's no way to do it on the current Xero invoices layout which is extremely limited.",1
"im assuming this just isn't in the pipe line as this thread was opened years ago, im not sure if im reading it right.. but was it created in 2012!? and has loads of votes. im on the discounted trail for 6 months, but cant see me sticking with xero solely down to needing custom fields on products, and then being able to put that information on a delivery note or invoice.

we deal with explosives which have a gross weight and explosive content weight that we need to give our customers and infomation like CE number etc

we currently use sage 50 accounts and was looking to move as xero does seem user friendly, but the most important thing was your mobile app, which Sage doesn't do unfortunately, but looks like were going to have to stay there as the reports are full customization and i can have all the information needed for our products and customers",1
How has this not been implemented yet? I’m on the trial period and am now actively looking for another program as it seems clear that Xero will not be changing this restrictive functionality. How in 2025 is this not a thing?,1
"Custom fields is a standard feature in accounting systems.  It should be available on each entitity - invoices, bills, contacts, assets, products.",1
Custom fields would also be helpful in Quote templates. I see this has been discussed for over 2.5years and clearly doesn't seem to be a priority. Ideally it would also be helpful to create a 'prospect' tag for quotes as quite often quotes are sent to companies that are not yet a customer.,1
Custom fields in the Contacts will enable us to clear up our customer data between Xero and our CRM.  It will help a lot!!,2
"This functional is extremely important and reduces me having to notify approvers to approve.

This feature really is a must",2
"We have only just introduced using the Xero expenses function and I was very surprised to find that notifications of expenses to be authorised wasn't included. 
 This function is a crucial feature and needs to be looked at urgently.  Not having the notifications is a major drawback of the current system.",1
Is this feature now available,2
"Not sure if this is live or not but I am receiveing email notifications for all expenses being submitted. There is no way to toggle this on/off, so now all our approvers/admins are receiving 150+ emails.

Xero support suggested to find our own workarounds to de-flag these emails in our inbox settings... Is there not a solution we can have in Xero instead?",1
All of a suddent I'm getting inundated with email notifications for expense submissions. How do I turn this off?!?!,1
"I can understand that being notified when an expense is submitted might be useful for some companies, but it should not be forced upon everyone. There MUST be an option to turn off the notifications in Xero.

Support says to find our own workaround but that's ridiculous. I shouldn't have to create email rules to block Xero emails. Please give us an option to stop the unwanted emails.",1
"Exactly - as below - my inbox is suddenly filling up with expense claim approval emails - absolute nightmare. How do I turn it off

Why has this been implemented with out telling us??

Far more important issues to fix like being able to see emails sent from Xero!!",1
"I can only assume Xero have not tested this or thought about the implications of sending emails to everyone! Surely, we should be able to specify who reports to which approver and emails and mobile notifications are only sent to the relevant approvers? I've worked in finance for over 20 years and used a multitude of accounting software and Xero is the ONLY one who does not specify approvers for individuals and give a choice of notifications. Xero - please do something about this!",1
I would like the option to turn this off for selected users.,2
"We need to be able to turn this function off. I currently oversee 49 companies, all who have staff using company cards and submit multiple expenses each week. I do not want an email each time they submit a receipt.  We approve receipts on a regular basis and do not want to be advised when one, or many, are waiting.
Please ensure there is a function to opt out of this, thank you",1
"It seems that email notifications has been introduced with no way to turn them off.  For some, I am sure, very useful for everyone else a nightmare of unwanted spam.  We need to be able to turn off unwanted emails",1
"I contacted Xero help to try to turn off these email notifications and was told there is no option to turn it off and "" If you're experiencing issues with these notifications or have concerns about their frequency, the user will need to look into alternative solutions or workarounds that might help manage their notification preferences better."" So they are just leaving it up to us to deal with. Seriously unhelpful. Why would they role out a new function without giving users to option to opt in/out for notifications?!?",1
"now you need to add a feature to be able to turn this off. we were using the app for this (notifications and approvals) so did not need e-mail's to provide reminders. 

and no warning that this change was coming",1
"I agree with other comments below - this has come out of the blue and is a feature we don't need at all, never asked for it, please make it optional with a setting to opt out! Just filling up the inboxes here.  Thanks in advance.",1
"I'm waiting for a solution to opt out email notifications for our users too.  
Please have the option to disable the email notification for ALL users easy instead needing to disable the function user by user.",1
"Agree with ALL prior comments... Please add an option to opt out of email notifications. Filling up the inboxes of the accounts team, managers & dept heads... we didn't ask for this, please remove.",1
"I agree. It is frustrating, and a full inbox just for notifications from XERO. Why isn't there an option to turn them on/off? There's no connection to who receives them. Receiving everyone! And our customers are now blaming us because we recommended using XERO.",0
"How do individuals turn this off please?
In our organisation it is simply not necessary for EVERY approver to have a notification of EVERY expense!  Different line managers approve different employees expenses - unless there is an option to set up who the approver is, there needs to be an option to disable this ASAP.  Many thanks :-)",1
Agree - really need to be able to turn OFF these email notifications.  They are unnecessary and annoying.,1
Agreed with all. Please add an option to opt out of email notification. Thank you!,2
"Please add an option to chose to receive notifications or not. This is spamming us now - we have multiple companies with lots of staff and thousands of expense claims per month. We can't handing this volume of notifications and to all admins and approvers. Also, can we have an option to select whose expenses each approver is to see and approve? This would help with company structure and departments. Now everyone can see everything which is not really helpful.",1
Terrible idea - inundated with emails all over the company.  Please can you TURN IT OFF as soon as possible.,1
How do I turn this OFF please?,2
We are suddenly getting unwanted emails on the status changes of claims. This is causing a great deal of frustration. Please implement an opt out feature for notifications as a matter of urgency. These notifications are only an improvement / upgrade if people have the option to opt in or out.,1
I have recently started getting emails when an expense is submitted for approval which is really annoying as we approve expenses once or twice a month so there is no need for us to have this. I have also received an email from our accountant this morning saying she is receiving the emails too which is not ideal either. I have had to take her off the expenses settings altogether so she doesnt receive these emails. This is not a good idea for all so an option to remove this email facility should be an option ASAP!,1
"Agree with all, please advise on how to turn notifications OFF",2
is there a way to turn this off? need this ASAP,2
"We have far too many emails coming through, the ability to be able to turn off the email notifications would be absolutely necessary",2
"This is just silly!  

We approved expense claims daily and definitely don't need an email for every single expense claim submitted.  I can't believe Xero would implement such a silly ""feature"" for a few people too lazy to check their dashboard when there is more important reporting that really could be implemented that would actually be helpful to the majority of users!

We need a way to switch off these incredibly unhelpful notification that is just spamming multiple email boxes and wasting time!

Please get this either switched off or give us the choice to do it ourselves as a matter of top priority!",1
"I am not a fan of this new email notification as I only use the expense app for my employees who have a company credit card, they are not getting reimbursed and I check these every few days to reconcile the receipts against the bank rec so these emails, (and there are many of them), are a big problem for us, like junk emails really. I would prefer the option to switch off, especially when using company money. My work around until Xero hopefully fixes this was to add a rule and send all the emails direct to a folder and then delete these weekly.",1
"I contacted Xero to ask for help to turn this off, below is what I received.

They have used some of us as guinea pigs without consultation. Personal emails have been filled up with this nonsense! 

This is disgusting behaviour from Xero and giving us no ability to turn it off! This is just another stupid reason to up the cost of using Xero and still not put in features we actually need like the ability to put bills on hold, so we don't pay them!

Xero consistently makes using this program a nightmare!
 
Who is the person in Xero who thinks "" I know, I will selective some of our customers to spam! I will sit back and watch how many of them complain, then do nothing about it, I am also going to tell them we are not going to fix it""

************************************************************
Thank you for reaching out to Xero support.

Currently, Xero does not offer an option to turn off email notifications related to expenses.

Because this is a new product feature recently launched. It has been rolled out to some users and organizations based on feedback, which you can find in the link attached below. If you'd like, you can comment on the idea to express your interest in having the option to turn this feature off for selected users. This feedback will be valuable for our product team to consider for future updates.

These notifications are designed to keep users informed about important updates and actions required as part of the expense management process.

I've attached some Xero Central articles for more information.",1
This is an awful feature Xero. You're now clogging up my inbox with emails that are not necessary. It is not up to you to decide how we manage our expenses internally and to what timeframe. We have a perfect system set up and now all expense approvers are getting this email every time someone adds an expense. Please give us the option to turn it off ASAP.,1
"How do you turn this notification off? 
We have managers getting notified of staff expenses (which aren't there staff).
Because you don't offer the ability to assign staff to an approver.
This is creating issues with our management!",1
"Agree, we need the feature to turn this on or OFF",1
"Another vote for the ability to turn this off please. Better still, offer choice. The ability to assign an approver to each submitter, and every person (submitters and approvers) to be able to choose if/how they are notified.",1
How can we turn off this feature? This isn't helpful at all. It just adds noise to already busy inbox.,1
"I've been added to the approval email list and I don't even work for the business, I'm linked as the accountants, this is not working as it should.",1
It would be good if there was an option to turn off email notifications related to expenses for selected users. Thank you,2
This is important to me,2
"Dammit.  This hasn't been a focus for over the three years I've been griping about it.  Seems that Xero is still focused on cutsie bells and whistles stuff while ignoring the fact that, for it's users, Xero sucks.  Fix the issues that impede your users ability to efficiently execute their jobs.  And quit sending out the propoganda emails touting how great Xero is.  We users don't share the sentiment that you guys are shoveling.",0
Why is this not a priority to fix? This is a basic Accounts Payable function - it's not just helpful it's really important ... the  same as a  creditors' activity statement. Both have been issues for years now.,1
"Xero has merged the two separate requests to increase batch limit from 200, and to allow a filter on batches. I can see how a filter can help to reduce batch size to under 200 in some cases. But by combining both these requests into one, that just creates a larger job. Hence the new response now that no action is being taken:o)",1
"Please prioritise this development, we are a large business and the items per page needs to be increased to avoid excessive time spent creating multiple batch payments",2
Please update your priorities! - this has been requested since 2012! that's 13 years of being ignored. And especially as over those years the digital uptake in business documents is HUGE! - This is vital! Please provide an update from Xero!,1
Surely this can't be too complicated to implement -- will save a lot of people a lot of time!,1
"This should be a priority (can't understand how do they say this isn't a focus at the moment)as it creates extra work and make it complex to make monthly payment batches which involves 1000's of bills. As this has been a concern for couple of years and If you can't fix this sooner, please at least increase the number of bills shown in a page to 1,000, not currently showing 200.For example Xero Aged Payables details report shows up to 1,000 invoices per page. Please act quicker!",1
"Totally agree with Supun - Xero should easily be able to cope with a batch of more than 200 bills.  It is basic.  Although I have noticed a lot of basic features missing on Xero, like selecting date ranges on some layouts, only available by paying for add ons.  If Xero keeps restricting basic features to 'optional extras' then it'll become useless for us.",1
"I'm disappointed that this is being put on the back burner as its surely not a big thing to increase the number of bills visible per page. Every other platform offers a ""Show All"" option. The moment you implement that, it will fix the issue with not keeping the ticks in place across multiple pages.

Its extemely frustrating when trying to make Batch Payments for those of us with suppliers who have over 200 bills each month.",1
i agree - 200 displayed bills isn't enough per page.  Increase this to a 1000 and it will save me time,1
"I've been a user for a couple of months now and I've already seen the admins say ""nah, we have no plan to do that"" to two ridiculously easy to implement changes that would save users immense amounts of time. Like, your intern could knock this out during your lunch break. Seriously WTF?!",0
I think xero isn’t really aimed at larger companies with lots of transactions. I suggest moving to another provider who does this better.,3
I agree with other users that this is such an easy trap to fall into so there should be an easy escape route,2
"Agree with all comments, needs to happen some way.",2
having to vote for something that should be a basic feature. lmao.,1
Should be possible.,2
need this feature.,2
Need this feature!,2
Absolutely essentially. Please fix this bug.,2
Why isn't this feature already created?,2
Yes please. Doesn't allow any room for error.,2
Need this feature!,2
"We all make mistakes and need to be able to fix them

We need this feature now",2
Why isn't this a feature?,2
"One more area where the Xero system is unbelievably stupid.

I can delete an invoice. I can void an invoice. But I can't delete a voided invoice. Makes no sense. 

I can change an invoice number before voiding, then void. Why can't I change it once its voided if I forgot to do it?

This causes serious issues when attempting to integrate Xero with anything else. 

So frustrating.",1
"This is causing me angst. I need that invoice number, and I can't use it. A completely stupid system that I won't be using for much longer. At least financial year is ending soon and I can get rid of this ****",0
It seems almost impossible to retrieve a void invoice while in accounting you should always have connecting invoice number. So once removed is not changeable seems to me for fraud tax. please change this in your system so that we as a company do not commit “fraud”.,1
"This effects my sequential numbering & is really frustrating. 

Can we not simply have an 'unapproved' feature instead of being forced to void, in case of errors or change of circumstance to a job?",1
Essential feature,2
Please allow me to use void invoice number. Mistake happens sometime and we need to fix it,2
"Please add function to reinstate a voided invoice.  We had one deleted in error and paid for by the client, but now can only match their payment against a new invoice for as a payment without invoice.",2
100% this feature is needed - either give us the ability to fully delete invoices so we can re-create new ones with the same number or let us un-void an invoice so that we can use the invoice number we have locked up!,2
"Support !!! Thisis a MUST needed featues in a mature system.
A proper clean and sweep off the deleted invoice number is the flexibility for remedies function for users if we are accidentially deleted that particular invoice number and MUST require to clean it off without residue likea ghost inside the Xero system. In some situations, it helps to co-operate and recconnect the external application linking.

In my case, it helps to prove the fact rather than forced someone to head-down and consent this is our fault than a system bugs on that software.",1
Really need this feature be added. Either by enabling you to reuse the same invoice number from a voided invoice or to at least go in an edit the invoice number of the voided invoice to make it unique. This seems like something that could be a really easy fix.,1
"Whilst I agree with comments, I have voided an invoice by mistake and would like the option to unvoid, when it is done in error",2
"Hi Campbell,

While your AI-generated post arguing against this feature request has some valid points, it does not address what many of the comments are calling for. Once an invoice has been voided, it can't be un-voided or changed, and it blocks re-use of the number. This is very inflexible and does not allow for user error.

This can cause issues, for example, if invoice numbers need to match an external system like an online store. If something goes wrong and an invoice is even briefly entered with a wrong number, then it can't be fixed to match reality. My system imports orders from a BigCommerce web store and uses the Xero API to automatically create an invoice with a matching number. But if something goes wrong and the invoice needs to be reimported or another invoice was even briefly entered with a conflicting number by mistake, there's no way to recover.

Perhaps the best solution would be to default Xero to the current functionality, but allow users the option to enable unvoiding invoices and/or reusing invoice numbers.",1
"The comments from Geoff and Paul certainly resonate with me. The reason for having the ability to ""un-void"" or re-instate a voided invoice is simply to allow for error. Whether this be human error or system error it is important for us that an invoice that has been issued to a customer and is then voided by accident can be re-instated. It does not make sense that any acton cannot be undone when an error is made.

Similarly, if an invoice is created in error, the ability to void it and then re-use the invoice number is important when using sequential invoice numbers across different systems.",1
"It is essential for us to be able to spread the cost of an annual bill thoughout the year.
We receive many invoices annually / quarterly and this would save a lot of time.",2
"Yes, we have bills that the payment is deferred for a few months, then we pay it in instalments.  Being able to enter this information is just as important as a normal bill due the following month.",2
"Prorate bills across months or departments. E.g. annual insurance, annual subscription payments. Now I am booking bill in prepayment account and reversing via manual journal monthly. There must be a better way.",2
Honestly pretty surprised that this functionality doesn't exist yet.  Would save a lot of time and increase accuracy of periodic figures by a whole lot.,2
This idea is approaching its 12th birthday. Its important to reduce duplicated data entry and to ensure that your whole-or-organisation budgets are correct.,1
The functionality of this option is limitless. Not being able to do bottom up budgeting by categories is inconceivable.,1
"It seems inconceivable that you have to enter a separate budget for each tracking category, and then have to undertake a manual exercise to ensure that they reconcile to the total company budget.",2
This would save a lot of time and effort!,2
"we really need this
budgeting by tracking categories within the nominal code",2
"We need this.  We waste time entering all our individual budgets by tracking option into Xero every year; there's so little useful functionality in Xero. All our monthly and YTD accounting by client has to be done in Excel to get any useful, readable data.",1
Xero you are bleeding customers due to increased fees. That you aren’t prioritising upgrades that are standard features for your competitors is shocking. Provide a timetable for beta and full deployment schedule for each idea so that we can actually see it working its way through the apps dev pipeline!!!,1
"We have now reached 12 years!!!

From and including: Tuesday, 22 January 2013
To, but not including Wednesday, 29 January 2025

144 months, 7 days excluding the end date.",1
"I'd like very much to trial early payment discounts with my clients, but despite using some pretty sophisticated accounting software - by the way, that's your product Xero - I can't add this simple thing to an invoice. Wow! 

If this functionality hasn't been implemented in 12 years, there must be a reason.",1
Has this been solved?,2
"Has this not been implemented yet?

We are just busy moving from Pastel to Xero. So far the support has been less than adequate. So much so that I am contemplating reversing my decision.",1
"Lol - it is clear that Xero ignores this chat. 

The feature would be excellent.  Maybe someone should start the chat on LinkedIn; it may garner some attention if we move the conversation there.   Otherwise, the product overall is good. 

It would be nice if they had a product team that engaged users from time to time. I don't think they have account managers to check in with customers.  Sad, if I treated my customers like this, I would not have any!

I'll check back here in another 5 years!",1
"This feature would be a great addition to Xero and a feature that everyone seems to be crying for!!

We have looked at Paidnice and while that would solve our concern, we cannot warrant the monthly fee as we do not invoice that frequently being a smaller business. 

Our Xero subscriptions goes up constantly, yet no new features to prove its worth! 

Please Xero, can we have this feature added. Surely you can see it’s a feature worthwhile - it’s been requested for 12 years!!!",1
We have several customer would like us to implement a 2% 10 net 30 payment policy. We have always been able to do this in other programs. Seems like a fairly common request.,2
"Can't believe this still hasn't been implemented... Oh wait, that's right these Xero devs don't do anything.",1
"Wow, 13 years already. Talking about slow",1
Seems like this was a waste of time logging in here if this has been 13 years,1
Setting up settlement discounts on Accounts Payables without having to create a credit note.,2
"Ah, I've been ushered into this little corner of Xero that no one ever checks.",1
"This seems like a no brainer, fairly easy to develop and encourages best business practice. XERO let's get it done!",1
I want to offer a discount if someone pays by bank transfer rather than credit card as credit card fees are getting very expensive.,2
"Please add a prompt payment discount facility , I need to have a discount of 10% if paid within 7 days of statement for a particular customer, that then disappeares after those 7 days is up.",2
"1%10 Net 30, 2% 10 Net 30 are normal discounts that would be helpful if auto-calculated vs manually adding on each bill.",2
"This channel has become my daily source of laughter!  Don't get me wrong, I, too, desperately want this feature. Buy after YEARS of XERO response, I'm not sure that the XERO team even gives a [insert your preferred word here].

Happy Friday!",1
"To create a bill, you have to navigate to customer->create customer->scroll halfway down a page to input customer details, and then navigate to create bill, and complete the transaction. This is like 4 times as labour intensive as simply transferring money via bank account, and makes all of the increased reconciliatory functionality borderline redundant. Obviously fine if you're paying the same company over and over, but when you work with hundreds of contractors who you pay once, this is a nightmare. The approach to this within invoicing, where you can add customer details inline is elite in comparison. Please bring us this!",1
"It is very frustrating to not be able to bring the Description field from a Bank Transaction when setting up a Bank Rule.  The Description field often contains specific details which are required for coding purposes or checking that the transactions have been coded correctly.
Xero PLEASE get up to date with this!!",1
I'm a new user and am amazed this function does not exist - should be a quick fix and make my life a lot easier.  Please can it be included!,1
The Statement Description contains all the information about my transaction and is far too long to be in the Xero Reference field. Please find a fix,1
"This would be a very helpful feature.   It seems an obvious thing to enable a bank rule to populate the description field from the bank feed.    

Bank feeds tend to be very standard in content and layout.

The reference field can be programmed in this way.  Please can you add this feature to the description box?",2
"I agree with all of the above.  This seems like a basic function which should be a part of any auto-reconciliation within accounting software.  The bank rules are very generalised and do not specifically address the need to have a blanket rule applied to find each different description which customers use.  Adding to that, if Xero could add a function which shows any matching invoice numbers to be shown on the bank feed - no matter what the balance is or whether it matches exactly.  We all know how to allocate part payments to invoices, however having that invoice come up initially would allow us to split the payment.  Far quicker processing - which is one of the selling points for all accounting software.",1
"I also agree with all above. It is important to have the bank description in the accounting record. I can achieve this by manually coding in the bank reconciliation itself or in cash coding but that negates the point of the bank rule. The bank rule is there to make coding more efficient/consistent. 

It fails in its objective if you cannot bring the bits of the bank statement that you want into the description. I cannot justify coding 2000+lines a month manually. 

This also feels like a very quick fix. Please Xero...when are you going to fix it?",1
"Xero team, We're currently manually copying and pasting descriptions from bank feed.  This is necessary for audit trail and also for quality checks we run based on transaction description.

i know folks have voted and commented on this idea, but no feedback from Xero.  Would someone please at least acknowledge and let us know if this is in the works or if we should find a third party solution, like a Chrome extension as a solution.

I think the worst part is just not knowing.",1
"Please add this feature, cause it will make our workflow less effort and avoid unnecessary errors",2
Agreed. How has this not been implemented yet. Seem's like such a basic fix.,2
This is a super important feature to add : BS and cash flow budget will make our life much easier and decision making faster,2
"Ha...after three years and 174 votes, we're still waiting for this",1
"Yes still waiting - but they will spend time changing the sales invoices into a way we don’t want them for no reason, but ignore the points that actually need to be worked on like this!",1
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Budgets would make compiling management accounts so much easier & quicker instead of exporting to Excel and calculating it manually every month.,2
"Xero has no interest in creating budgeted balance sheet and budgeted cashflow!! so frustrating but it will not due to its business model of making more money from other intergrated programes!! 

Come on Xero - man up and do the right thing by your xero subscribers!",1
"Balance sheet is where cash is!  How can you not have a business plan without budgeting for cash.  Inventory, accounts receivable, debt....businesses have to budget for these line items.  Only having capability for income and expenses, is a very simplistic cash basis cash flow model.  Xero needs to add this feature.  Would love to do all financials inside Xero, not Actual vs Budget Balance Sheet externally.",2
Idea was submitted 12 years ago! I hear this feature might be on the cards for release after 2030. Something for the next generation to look forward to I guess.,1
Come on Xero - I will start sending clients back to MYOB desktop if you cant even manage this,0
"Why bother having a budgeting feature if you're missing all the key components like loan repayments, HP repayments, ATO repayments, etc, etc",1
"I think it ridiculous that all the implementation that is and has been completed over the last couple of years are all cosmetic and add absolutely no value to us as accountants.  Everything that is asked for is ignored, and stuff that is irrelevant is being updated.  It really baffles me.",1
"EXTREMELY disappointiong Xero!!! 
And you call yourself an accounting package!! A critical part of accouting is budgeting.",0
"Balance Sheet Budgets are critical for our business because as a developer, all our development costs sit in the B/S until sale when they are then brought to P&L which can be up to 2 years.  So, we really need a Balance Sheet Budget to see how our Actuals are tracking against these Budgets. Banks are also more and more asking for P&L, Balance Sheet and Cashflow Budgets so would be really helpful to be able to get them all from Xero.",2
"""building this feature isn't in our plans"". Speaks volumes about the leadership of this software. Far too much emphasis on software cosmetics over functionality.",1
"I can't quite see why this is so hard to add in a few extra lines into the Budget manager (and Cashflow Forecast reports), i.e. add in a new section into the budget manager called 'Less Capital Items', then we can account for drawings, tax, hire purchase or loan repayments, etc in the budget?? 

Most of my clients want this feature and quite often either banks or brokers are after forecasts to account for ALL cash items (not just income and expenses)...",1

"To allow multiple contacts under the same company. 

Purposes: To save time changing of contact details, since some clients dealt with the same company with different people.",2
"Ability to add delivery address to quote/invoices. 

Purpose: To save time from having to edit a contact to add a street address.",2
We have various customers with multiple addresses for which we can't invoice through Xero.,2
"I use distributors, so have multiple ship-to's that I need on a purchase order.",2
We have customers that have different locations that we would like to bill them for.,2
The ability to set up one customer with multiple delivery addresses is a pretty basic function and one that many other on line providers offer as standard. Please release this functionality ASAP.,1
"As a compnay we supply services to property managers but they need the invoice to go directly to their landlords, to have to create multiple contacts for all the individual properties for the same client would be really complicated and would mean we don't have a proper history for the client as all invoices would be spread across multiple contacts.",2
Ability to change the customer address on unique invoices (so not always the address of the contact),2
"Each account should be able to have a child account under its parent. I have clients with many sites under one umbrella, making it challenging to enter each site as a new customer. ",1
"Ability to access an address book when sending a quote. 

Some clients have multiple managers and the quote doesn't always go to the same person nor to accounts. Currently we have to cut and paste the email address in from another piece of software. which is quite time consuming",1
"Hi Everyone, I also urgently need this feature building in as standard. I love Xero but my client is less than convinced due to this missing  multiple delivery address feature. Hope it gets sorted soon !",3
I'm surprised this important/basic feature has been ignored for so long by Xero.,1
"Hi,
This is not necessarily what I require....Multiple addresses etc.
I need additional fields in contacts, so I can store Nationality, D.O.B., Gender, Food Allergy, Medication. 
This is important for some of my clients when using Xero.
Let me know as and when you develop.
Thanks

"This is essential for my business, please get it sorted ASAP!",2
"Essential, please get it sorted!",2
"To be clear, not just ability to add multiple persons to a contact and send to all, it should allow the user to select the primary person (and email) from the list of persons associated with the contact, and optionally to select other persons from the list to copy in. ",2
"I have clients with different delivery addresses, home, office, depot etc. At the moment, I have to go to the customer detail screen, change the delivery address, create the invoice and go back to the customer screen to enter the main address again. My old system allowed multiple delivery addresses from a dropdown box. This was a sensible solution.",2
"I personally think that Xero needs to add additional fields on the invoice template so you can manually input delivery addresses. 

Some businesses work with multiple customers per day, but on a Cash basis and don't necessarily want to create a contact for each of the customers. So the ability to create a CASH Contact to invoice these clients on, and just add the delivery address and additional billing details if required would be great.

"We also require something along these lines i.e. the ability to assign an individual in an organisation to a department such as, the PO contact, the accounts contact, the sales contact etc. So the system is intelligent enough to know when you are sending a PO, which emails to send it to and so on. 

We have to essentially add the contact details right now, select include in emails and then try to remember who POs go to, who invoices go to and delete the unnecessary email addresses. Pretty tedious.",1

Can you please respond to the requests of users to have notifications for payments. When a payment is received an alert, ideally email, is sent to the user. 

This seems to be a simply implementation, and users have been asking for many years. 

Please respond. 

Thanks,

Being able to create your own field in contacts would be great!  We pay a lot of our vendors by Zelle and would like to keep their email or phone # that is connected to their zelle account which maybe different than their business email or phone #.  Or just have a general Notes section so we can input notes we would like to see when looking at vendor.,3

We currently have to put these address into Xero as a Item so that the information as already in the system and data entry mistakes aren't made but it is a bit crazy esp when the rudimentary Xero reports will include the Item in reports that then make the report meaningless or just inaccurate for mamangement information.

This is incredibly important - we have many customers with multiple service locations and some of these customers won't accept Xero invoices due to the fact we can't show the service location address on the invoice unless we update it on the system every single time which is time consuming when Xero is supposed to be making our lives easier!,0
"WAY TO GO XERO......

Instead of fixing this issue, you have changed the way that you update client details.  Instead of amending client postal address, physical address and phone number etc on the one screen, lets put in a process that takes three times as long as you have to go into three different screens to update this information.

Why do your programmers insist on creating more problems instead of fixing that ones that we have been asking for for over 10 years......

"Hi all

We've been using a work around by changing the delivery address for accounts to match their requirements. As we add more customers, many larger than we've traditionally dealt with, this is becoming a complicated and time consuming task.

Example 3 - Single company with various departments, each with individual delivery addresses.

Our current work around to deal with multiple delivery addresses is very time consuming especially now with the new Contact layout and tabs. 

Double checking all the right info has been entered for a contact is also a hassle now with all the different tabs. 

Can Xero please go back to the old 'Contact' layout on the one page and have the ability to add multiple delivery addresses before we have to jump ship.",2
We have numerous solicitor's companies which have the same name but different addresses but under the new set up if we already have e.g Fred Blogs and Co in it will not allow us to add another fred bloggs and co with a different address - very annoying and inconvenient.

"Personally can't believe this functionality hasn't been created given the amount of businesses that have multiple shipments locations for the same business.

"A few clients need this , one reason the won’t come to xero ",1
It's frustrating when dealing with multiple contracts and departments within the same company.  Currently each contract with the same client is set up with a new debtor record with new contact details.  It makes reporting time consuming if you have to go through and add them all together to get anything meaningful around your debtors.  Other software packages can deal with it - how do they do it?  I appreciate your time in looking into this.,1
Many customers have multiple shipping addresses. It's very annoying that these cannot be stored so you can choose the shipping address for a particular order. I know that Sage allows for this and it seems crazy Xero as advanced as it is does not. Please sort it out Xero. All I can do currently is save the addresses previously used under notes for the customer.,1
"Multiple delivery points are very common and having just moved from a competitor a single delivery point in addition to the billing address is very inconvenient.
As Xero expands its customer base there will be an increasing need for multiple delivery addresses, it should not be delayed.",2

"Hello Kelly,

This feature was requested over ten years ago. The recent ""upgrades"" to contacts has actually made contacts more time consuming, confusing, and difficult to use. It would be great if Xero could continue to move in the direction of making the product better without making it more difficult to use in the process.

We have multiple delivery addresses for each customer so this would be very useful as at the moment we have to re-enter the delivery address everytime we raise a new invoice,2
Data Relationship 101 - create 1 company (type = Customer or Supplier) with many contact records allowed,2
This is a much needed feature.  We often have once finance company that we need to bill but for multiple customers and delivery details.,2
"Recently discovered this issue as we have been asked to provide services to multiple sites for an international group with one invoicing address. Yes, documents can be manually adjusted to reflect the site where the services were delivered but shouldn't have to do it that way. Especially considering one of the reasons for selecting Xero from the start was the ability to create branded document templates.",2
"I've just had a customer question an invoice reminder as it had the incorrect delivery address on it. This is a direct result of having only one delivery address per contact. The original invoice was sent out with the correct delivery address, but we then had to change the address to accommodate the next order. The invoice reminders default to the current delivery address not the original. So what I thought was an inconvenient but doable work-around doesn't really work after all. Once more, I implore Xero to take the request for multiple delivery addresses per contact seriously and put some resource behind fixing it.",1
I have contacts with more than 5 addresses! Please add this feature!,2
It's very basic and much needed features!,1
"Very disappointed after been sold Xero as very intuitive and easy software and turns out that one of the most basic fields on invoicing is not been implemented from the start. I cannot believe that every time we have to resend invoices we have to type manually the delivery address and save it in the pc doubling the work and making other functionalities on Xero worthless. 

This is a very basic functionality and the fact that changes the invoice details based on the contact address is just very poor.

I hope you can resolve this very soon as I can see people are been asking for a few years already and nothing is been done yet.

"Hi Kelly Munro,

Why the delivery address has to rely on contact data? Why not creating an additional field in the invoice page and the delivery address gets linked into each individual invoice like other fields (Reference, items, description of goods,....) That way the invoices won't change. 

I am sure that won't take too long to implement...

"What Toni is suggesting below is exactly what we are looking for as well. If the address could be tied to the individual invoice rather than the client level, that would solve many of the issues we are having. As others noted, it causes issues when needing to resend the invoice and/or send invoice reminders if the invoice address is different from what's under the contact defaults. ",2
"When viewing invoices that have been entered using ""new invoicing"", it would be extremely useful to have the Delivery Address appear on the New Invoice Screen in a similar manner to New Bill Screen.  Saves time when having to go back through multiple invoices for one customer with different delivery addresses, to more easily resolve invoice dispute or delivery address enquiry!",2
This is a must. We have clients with different contacts for different branches. Also more than 2 addresses are required.,2
"This is a major flaw in Xero, that when you edit the delivery address for a contact that it changes the address when the client uses the link for all previous invoices. There needs to be a separate field (similar to the field where the invoice number is entered) for a unique delivery address to be added for each invoice.",1
"we have noticed the recent change in Conacts to allow Deliery addresses as well as billing addresses...great start...but unworkable as the delivey address becomes part of the Invoice address...just with the Itlaicises ATTENTION and the details..

As far as i can see nothing has been done for this to be actioned. 
Xero team please correct me if I am wrong.

In my frustrations with this i have been following closely what changes have been made and in my opinion the only changes that have been made are for the Accounting / Tax side of the software.

As many of you will probably agree we moved from a competitor (that did allow multiple delivery addresses) on the advise of our Accountants ... 

Therefor all i can suggest is what i am doing and putting pressure back on my Accountants to send requests to Xero to get this changed or at least a seriously high priority on this matter.

What I did not expect is that this procedure also changes the address on all former and accepted quotes to this client. Quotes are important contractual and legal document forming part of the purchase contract and once a quote is accepted it should never change. At least not unintentionally.",0

I am really not interested in excuses from Xero about how complex their systems are, we need solutions not excuses and platitudes.

Many of our customers use various supplier portals (each with their own url and login details etc) others require invoices to be sent to a specific email address.  It would be very helpful to have a free text field in the Customer attribute to allow us to record how invoices should be presented to the specific customer.  The field should be large enough to support a URL, username and password and some free text if necessary.",2
Another way Xero could design this is to have multiple sub contacts under a main contact. For example McDonald's is the main contact but then you have McDonald's - Brisbane CBD as a sub contact. Just a thought...,2

Now we have the ability to add multiple emails per contact. I don't see see why this has not been implemented yet!,1
"I think xero is overthinking this.  The way it works in quickbooks and others is you can freeform paste in a shipping address during invoice creating.  Since our clients jobs (contruction) go from address to address, it is not important to keep this info in a record beyond just the invoice.

Let me repeat: we have customers where the shipping invoice is NEVER the same and it changes EVERY bill.

What most people are doing now in xero is adding it to the reference field or pasting in a ""freight"" item line.  So why not just have an optionally-filled ship to line that can be pasted into as customers are already doing with these workarounds??",0

For anyone interested - the transcript of my e-mail is below

This is not customer service - it's rudeness.

May I take the opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment and thank you for your introductory e-mail, which has arrived at a particularly opportune moment as I have become increasingly frustrated with the lack of feedback and basic customer service from Xero over recent months. 
Writing comments and suggestions via Xero Central seems to be like shouting into a void. One particular issue that has been ongoing for almost a year now concerns the facility (or rather the current lack of it) for multiple delivery addresses to be stored for each contact, a facility supported now by over 400 of your clients. If you look at the timeline, there has been only one response from Xero (in September 2022) in which we were all told by Kelly Munro that Xero were working hard behind the scenes…. but nothing since. Having posted to the forum again in January and still not received a reply, I took to Twitter as follows:

still no update on multiple delivery address capability - ongoing for a year. 400 of your users have told you this is crucial, but no comment from Xero since 11 Sep 2022. Ignoring your customers is never a good idea.

@graham_tottle
Thanks for the prompt and feedback. We're not ignoring you ... there is no further update. Per the post from us in September, we're undertaking work behind the scenes which will allow us to more easily add new features and ideas like this. ^OG

From a customer’s point of view, these replies are somewhat condescending and patronising. It is unacceptable to be “kept in the dark” in this way with no timescale for Beta testing or implementation mentioned. To be told that “it’s complicated and we are working on it” is just not good enough.  I believe that we are entitled to expect better.

Please upgrade this asap!! If the technology needs upgrading for such a simple feature then this should be priority otherwise how else will anything be upgraded. Really considering moving to MYOB...,0
Thank you for the update Kelly! Can't wait to see how the feature functions.,4
"Hope to see the solution live soon. It's a common feature in all software.
Thank you for your speedily work on it to solve it.

Thank you",4
"I first commented on this thread about the need for the ability to assign multiple prices for a product across different customers. 
I have one product that 10 customers use - I have had to create 10 different product codes in order to have that price available on the system, even though its the same product.
e.g A price for Customer 'A', I have code 9999A for $xx 
Customer B has a different price, so I have code 9999B - the exact same product but now with Price $yy
To work out how many of product 9999 I've actually sold in total I need to export to Excel and run formulas.
I have 65 different products I am doing this with - we're up to about 4000 codes to cover it all.

This thread seems to have morphed into multiple addresses per customers.
We need both!",2
Thank you for the update Kelly as we are needing this feature for our business. It would be good if the multiple delivery address synced with Workflowmax too.,3
"This has taken some time, it would also be good to have an option for landlord option, for example mr Jones owns 3 apartments 2 house, he can be involved for all service charge for these instead of having multiple customer. ",2
"Desperate for this to become a feature. I have mainly corporates with various clients inside those corporates to deal with. I can't set each up as a client.

They all have the same billing details, but different areas within the business.

So COMPANY > Client 1; Client 2; Client 3; etc

Please make this happen.

Thanks!",2
"I can see you can add a contact and then add this contact to a group, but this will lead to thousands of contacts which will only be used once.
We have all estate invoices in a group called ""Customer Invoices"" but then each invoice will be addressed to different customers/estates/executors so we cannot build this data in a generic template.
Is there a function to have the ""Customer Invoice"" template include a box where you can manually add the individual customer data such as name and address on raising the invoice so we can eliminate the need to add a contact each time that will never be used again.",2

"Currently on Page 5 of this idea Xero said this...

Xero Team (Admin, Xero) commented
Ability to add delivery address to quote/invoices.
Purpose: To save time from having to edit a contact to add a street address.

I think this proves that Xero is made by accountants for accountants. Although they don't seem to have much of a concept for what a legal entity is, or how businesses actually work, where products and services can be delivered to more than one address.

Anyway I'll wait another couple of years to see if this progresses any further.",1

Please add field for ""delivery address"" and ""customer PO number""  when preparing Invoice with ability in the template. Nothing to do with contact.",2
"Example : I sell goods to ""ABC"" company but to delivery to their customers all over the place. so I have to create an invoice to bill them and show them where i delivered to. no need to add delivery adddress into contact,  just save in that particular invoice",2

"As a sub-contractor for construction companies, we are dealing with various people within that company - accounts, estimators, foremans, owners etc. As an quick fix, we are already capturing if the contact is to be included in emails - can this be expanded to display all contacts for the company in the drop down list when preparing an invoice, quote etc? 

Ideally, long term fix would be when creating a contact for the same company, we have the functionality to select emails to be included on - sales, bills etc. Then when preparing a quote or invoice all of the contacts for that company (filtered by contact email type) would be displayed in the drop down list and the user can select the appropriate contact(s). 

As a workaround - I have to add all contacts to receive emails and then manually delete those that aren't to receive the quote or invoice prior to sending. Using attached example, the contact for persontwo@test.com would also appear for this company ABC...and provide me with the ability to select either or both to receive this invoice.",2
"Is there any update on this please? I have a client wanting to change software but they won't use Xero unless this key feature is in place. They're looking at other software options, so I just wanted to check whether timescales are known before they look to commit elsewhere? Thanks.",1
Dear Xero. You may or may not be aware that Quickbooks Desktop is being discontinued on 30th June this year. Not having a different delivery address or multiple address options will be a deal breaker for many and they will choose other software over Xero.,1
Are Xero any further forward with this as it appears that this idea was started back in 2012 (11 years ago)?,1
"We deal with several large companies. Invoices will go out to the same company BUT with contact1+address1, contact2+address1 and contact2/address2, etc.
It is unclear to me if the brief description of the 'idea' will achieve what we need.
The irony is MYOB allowed us to do that but we believed all the marketing hype about Xero and changed. We deeply regret that change and either Xero invests in improving the product to service the businesses you advertise to or we will be switching back.",1
"Surely you have this sorted by now? Will need to move platform if it's not soon.
Can't thin why it's not complete considering other platforms have had it as staple for years.",0
"A year on - nearly 500  clients crying out for a solution and still nothing from Xero.
This feature (multiple delivery addresses) already exists in the Purchase Order screen, so it should be relatively straightforward to enable something similar for invoicing (if of course there is a will to do it.....) 
Shockingly slow effort from Xero. ",0
"Agreed with Graham Tottle
Don't Understand why just can't add in this simple yet important feature into invoice template. ",1
"I cannot believe this feature is still not live!  We got suckered in by the marketing claims from Xero and our so called advisor, and are actively looking to change.  Xero does not care about implementing multiple contacts, as long as people are still paying!!",0
Came here hoping that there would be a solution to this seemingly simple request. Looks like I am out of luck. How hard can it be to add a drop down box within a customer record to choose different FAO details!,0
I've given up waiting. Going with a different provider for me and my 80+ clients books. Too bad such a straight forward and every-day need was not deisgned in the orginal build or updated after they were notified of this significant deficiency.,0
"many of our customers are large organizations (like universities). While all the bills for invoices to different departments are paid by the university, we invoice the individual departments separately, and they all have separate contact information (emails, phone, mailing addresses). 

In Quickbooks, we used ""Jobs"" (which are basically folders inside the customer), for each department. Each Job could have its own contact info. Something like that would be welcome. As it is now, we have to have 22 separate customers just for one university, because that's how many departments we work with. Even though the checks for all of those come from the same place. ",2
We need the ability to have multiple contacts for and existing Client. The  purpose is to be able to send quotes to different project managers working for the same company.,2
"I agree, I am now creating a pdf of the invoice and manually emailing the invoice, this shouldn't be necessary.",1
"Hi Kelly, it's great you are working on this. 

I'm frustrated by the restriction of address fields to 2 only.

Below is my recent email to your support team.

We have many customers with more than 2 addresses, as below

1) Shop address
2) warehouse address
3) Billing address

However we are only able to add 2 addresses to the Contact Details page, which means valuable information is missing from their Contact records.

Can you please add an extra address field into the Contact Details Section?",3
"I cannot believe this function is not available. I also regret following the advice of our accountants to switch to Xero. Should have stuck with Quick Books as their  Customer 'Jobs' for those repeat customers with different delivery addresses worked perfectly.

"Yep requested along with 1000 other things (all about 5 to 10 years ago on the old ideas and comments system they conveniently removed) that would have made Xero the best in the market - but they know best.

It's telling that the last update from Xero was March 06, 2023.

"We have about 10 clients that would love to get off of Quickbooks...and on to Xero.  But Xero does not listen to the clients needs.  This feature is a basic requirement for most companies doing B2B transactions.

There are other request we have posted and they are being ignored by Xero development team.  How long will it take to implement those basic ideas.  I guess Xero does not want to improve their software.  What a waste of .... talent, time, money....everything about on this software. 

Mean-time we are on the sidelines..... waiting!",0

"I've had to create separate contacts for each Defence contract manager, because of this. There's a lot of them. Each invoice has to be CC'd to the correct contact when you send it to Defence accounts, and I'm not willing to bet on my ability to not make typos when changing things repeatedly, so multiple unnecessary contacts it is...",2
"This feature request has been ongoing since 2012. During this period, Xero removed the original dates from the discussion thread, and to make matters worse, they also deleted the original comments on this new ""Products Idea"" forum. Unfortunately, my comment is missing, so I'm reposting it here.

The issue is that if you do work for a big organisation with hundreds of employees and you are running multiple projects you can't invoice individual people or departments under the same organisation. I know you can add extra contacts but this still doesn't work, as I need the statements generated to ONLY include projects to that relevant team member.

I have resorted to fudging the company name by adding periods in various locations, for example:

Business Name PM Pty Ltd
Business Name PM Pty Ltd.
Business Name PM Pty. Ltd
Business Name PM Pty. Ltd.
Business Name PM. Pty Ltd
Business Name PM. Pty Ltd.
Business Name PM. Pty. Ltd.
Business Name. PM Pty Ltd

This is NOT a very elegant way of managing it and I have also run out of options!

Xero please advise if you are listening to your customers and if this will ever make it onto your roadmap.",0
"Reading Michelle Flynn's comments below fills me with anger. OMG. Such a simple yet essential feature is not being implement and clients are simply ignored.

Please remember to bring this up with Xero on Twitter and reference this thread when you do. I'm sure they appreciate the reminders,1
"This is an example of a platform development/services company that, up until recently, had the same issue as Xero does with regards to a lack of updates on most requested features like this one.

Seriously, I've reached a juncture that - without this feature - I'm going to need to migrate to a different platform.

An update, even if progress has been slow, is better than the radio silence we're been subjected to. And the great part? It'd be super easy to make happen with how engaged you are on your Twitter profile, and doesn't need massive capital or a budget to make happen.

You could say it'd cost you $0.00 to, ultimately, do right on your user base.

"Hi Kim,

Well the thread started in 2022 and I believe there have been 2 updates from Xero staff since. 

What you may not be aware of is the fact there used to be another system for ideas and reporting issues - that was ""wiped"" (sorry archived) due to the 3 or 4+ years of comments and ideas that were never actioned.

So in short - don't hold your breath.

I honestly believe a very high proportion of users (30% +) are seriously just waiting for a better online option that has the features of Xero - but actually cares about their paying customers.",1
"Completely agree with Kim and William on this one - the deafening silence from Xero is shocking. I note that after a few adverse comments on another issue (Show contacts on one page) the thread was ""closed"" recently - Xero said contributors were going off topic.... so I suspect the same will happen to this one shortly too. The new CEO (Sukhinder Singh Cassidy) promised more openness but when I wrote to her, I received a message back from her ""team"" (the people I was complaining about) repeating the same old platitudes, before presumably sending my comments to the recycling bin.
This feature (multiple delivery addresses) already exists as a feature on the Purchase Order screen, so it can't be difficult to implement, I am therefore left with no other option but to conclude that Xero don't want to do it for some reason and are not being honest in their (2) replies? Perhaps they are looking at a ""cost v benefit"" analysis that tells them they won't lose too many clients by not doing anything so it won't affect their bottom line too much - or am I being too cynical? Either way, I won't be recommending Xero to anyone until the situation changes for the better and as soon as practical will be moving to another platform with better customer service.
Sukhinder needs to get across this - I don't think they realise how angry their clients are about being fobbed off, patronised and ignored in this way.",0

Xero seem to be very good at implementing changes that have a negative impact  but might in their opinion make it look prettier and have more white space but all these changes are not adding function and value and the ideas posted here that are so heavily positively supported are continually ignored.

Changed to Xero this year believing we were moving to an innovative company with great customer service.  Saw this wasn't avail but was referred to this site about the time Kelly made her last update and mistakenly thought it was all in hand and would be dealt with soon.

Unfortunately I can now see that's not the case, and would definitely not recommend Xero to anyone, the customer service is worse than the company we came from and that's saying a lot!!!

It's such a drama to do basic tasks that are readily avail in other systems and constantly feel unprofessional in having to do things in ad hoc ways just to get what we need from the system.

If anyone discovers a good alternative please let us all know!!!",0

"Hi Muriel,

Don't hold your breath on getting an update from Kelly or anyone else at Xero on this.

The original request is OVER 10 YEARS OLD. It seems Xero is more interested in changing features that used to work to features that now require multiple clicks in multiple pop-ups to complete the work that could be done with one or two clicks in two screens previously.

Our work around is to create a separate account for each address we service for the same company. But you can't use the same account name more than once, so we add the number of the street address after the business name for each separate service address; NSW Realty 45, NSW Realty 903B, etc.

Good luck!

"I thought I would add a bit of technical information, as I have developed applications and databases in the past.

A common flaw when people create contact tables is to restrict the number of addresses that can be added to a contact, by putting that information in the same table. If they used a separate table for addresses (as I believe they do for phone numbers, as you can add multiple ones), then this would be somewhat easier to implement the request. I know, because that is how I do it in my programs.

Unfortunately, if this decision is incorrectly made at the beginning of the database design, then it becomes incredibly difficult the make the change, as you have to update so much stuff to change it (queries and procedures). It is not insignificant. So, unfortunately, I doubt that they will do anything about this.",1

"Xero's attitude to this ""issue"" is nothing short of contemptuous to its clients. The feature (to add different delivery addresses) exists in the Purchase Order screen, so the code is already written - why can't this be applied to the invoice page too?

So there is no way to track where an item was shipped unless we record it somewhere outside of Xero. Even just the step of keeping invoices intact as they were when created would be helpful!",2
"Hi Kelly checking to see status update for this query.

Can we get an update on this please; I have clients wanting to leave Xero due to this issue.
When is it likely to be release?

"Hi Kelly,

I can't believe how this thread has been ignored by Xero for so long. Bad news is better than no news. 

Please provide a timeframe (not another ""we are working on it"") about Xero's plans for this feature. If it is not going to be implemented, just let us know. 

Thank you",1
This is absolutely critical to the functionality of our invoicing system. Brokers represent our product so we are billing them but shipping products all over North America to hundreds of different delivery address.,1
"Can't believe you cannot store multiple individuals' phone numbers under a single company contact name.  Xero cannot be used as a contact database.
Please release into front end.",1
"Agreed with Graham Tottle 

The feature (to add different delivery addresses) exists in the Purchase Order screen, so the code is already written - why can't this be applied to the invoice page too?

You already ignore this request for more than 10 years, do something right now.

As I have it, and I picked this up on another Xero ""problem"" forum is that Xero is built on a very outdated ""backbone"" so to speak.
Any changes with Xero concerning direct application changes (not visual) to the application itself is very costly and they might not have the knowledge on how to implement it. That is why at every quarterly Xero update session, most if not all of the updates will be visual aspects e.g. how a report looks like, how many columns you can add etc. Basically taking info of forefront and present it in a different way.
If this issue of multiple contact addresses is so critical to your organisation or your clients', you have 2 options.
1 - contact Xero support directly or 1.1 take it up with your national representative and if not anything is done
2 - advise your clients to break away from Xero.
These 2 options is what I implemented option 2 always sufficed.

The updates that I have seen happen in Xero in the last 2 years have seemed to me to be pointless and token gestures of needless developments instead of focusing on developments that would actually be useful for us!
This is the 2nd most requested idea from Xero's customers so come on Xero - start listening to your client base or I for one will certainly be looking at moving elsewhere.",1

They have no interest. Sorry to disappoint.

Some bean counter has worked out that the churn rate for disgruntled clients will be less than the new customers they attract with their sh*t adverts on TV here in the UK.

So income goes up. Everyone (* at Xero) happy.

In 2023 there were 5,510,265 businesses of 0-49 emplyees - their target market. So there is an awfully big pool of people that will sign up and think all works fine for a few months.

They have zero interest in us and the only way we can ever get what we want is to actually walk.

I've use xero for almost 3 years and little has changed with most of the these basic functionality requests going on 10 years now.",1
"I agree with most of the comments on this thread - Xero clearly have no intention of keeping their customers updated or making the requested changes. In addition to the request for multiple delivery addresses, I have also been contributing to the thread on showing available stock levels in the quantity field when typing an invoice (as per the Classic system, the quotation and billing screens) Again, a deafening silence from Xero (as the coding already exists and is working in other templates, why is it so difficult to implement in Invoicing?)
Anyway, my head is hurting from ******* it against these particular brick walls (I even tried writing to the new CEO but she couldn't be bothered to reply either) so I think a change of tack is required. I have had a great deal of success recently in embarrassing large companies on X (formerly Twitter) so from now I think a regular (lack of) progress report on the Xero Twitter page will be forthcoming - perhaps it will save any potential new Xero customers from being disappointed..... if anyone cares to contribute their Twitter (I will always call it Twitter as I think the X title is just daft) handle is  @Xero",0

"We have been using Xero for about a year. Between this issue, the inability to send email through our own server to avoid getting tripped up in spam, and the inability to do an ACH payment through Stripe that doesn't involve the customer going to their bank to transfer to us, I've decided we're done. 

The canned responses I get from support feel like a slightly more polished version of what we used to get with Intuit - repetition of what you just said, with no satisfactory answer. And here, almost a year after Kelly posted that they're working on it, this still isn't implemented. I honestly don't think they have any plans to fix any of this stuff.

We're probably moving to Zoho. Cheaper per month, I've already test-imported all our company data, and they do regular updates and seem really responsive.

Hi Graham


Thank you for inviting Xero Support into your organisation.


It sounds like you want to enter multiple delivery addresses for a single contact record in Xero. If that's correct, this isn't currently possible in Xero but we've noted your interest in this feature and passed the feedback to our Product Team for inclusion in their regular reviews.


The Product Team is already looking into developing that functionality for the future and there's an existing Xero Product Idea for this feature where you can vote and comment on the request. I've included the link below. When there are any new developments or releases for this feature, we'll post an update on that page to let our users know.


In the meantime, one option would be to create a separate contact record in Xero for each delivery address. However, please note that every contact in Xero must have a unique name, so you'd need to enter a different name for each contact record. This can be as little as added a period or number to the name.


Alternatively, you could update the delivery address on each invoice as needed. With that method, the new address will automatically be saved to the contact record and update the details there as well.


I've included links to support articles with more information.

Dear Briana,

Thank you for your reply the format of which suggests that it is an edited cut and paste ""stock"" reply which has been used many times in response to several client complaints.
I am aware of the ""Xero Product Idea"" within Xero Central - indeed if you read the comments that go back several years, you will see that I have contributed many times. Unfortunately, despite Kelly Munro's assurances on March 6th 2023 that the team were ""working on it"" (see excerpt of her reply below) nothing has been heard from her in the intervening 12 months and a solution has still not been achieved for the (nearly 1000) clients who have voted for it.
---8<---
Kelly Munro - "" Multiple addresses has been enabled in the back end of contacts. As mentioned in our previous update this is a complex piece of work, as we need to now build this into other areas of Xero where it'll add value.

For this reason the work within Contacts is not live yet, as without building this feature across these other areas it wouldn't have much practical use. But to confirm, work's moving along and we look forward to being able to share more""
---8<---
I do not accept that a company the size of Xero with all of the IT specialists and technicians it employs can't find a way to resolve this quickly if the will to do so exists. The fact that this has been ongoing for so many years indicates that Xero is not taking the issue seriously despite its assurances to the contrary.
I am also aware of the ""work around"" involving setting up a separate account for each different delivery address - this is messy and time consuming. Furthermore, sending multiple statements out to a single entity, which this would necessitate, is impractical, time consuming and annoying for both vendor and purchaser. Analysing client sales / payment data would also be considerably more complex if multiple account files were to be set up in this way.
Similarly, editing the customer account with a new delivery address each time is both messy and time consuming - particularly as it has to be done on a line by line basis (it is not possible to simply cut and paste multiple lines of an address into the available fields).

My request also mentions another issue regarding the transition from Classic to ""New"" Invoicing, which you have not addressed. In Classic, the available stock was shown on the invoice template when entering a figure in the quantity column, however in the New Invoicing system it does not - meaning the operator has to open another ""session"" and view the available stock in ""Business / Products and Services"". Again, this is time consuming and effectively a downgrading of Xero's product. This functionality is still available in ""Quotes"" and indeed shows when raising a ""Credit Note"" within the Invoicing tab, so the coding obviously exists, leading me to think that Xero has deliberately turned the function off within Invoicing for some reason. Again, this is a popular topic on the ""Product Ideas"" page of Xero Central that has not been addressed by anyone at Xero since I first wrote about it in August 2022!
https://productideas.xero.com/forums/939198-for-small-businesses/suggestions/45529378-new-invoicing-show-stock-level-when-adding-a-tra

So, I remain highly unsatisfied and frustrated with the lack of progress and poor communication from Xero. I get the feeling that, on the rare occasions that Xero do reply, the aim of the reply is to stall, obfuscate and placate, with no intention to actually address the issues raised. My position therefore remains, that if at the end of my financial year Xero has not addresses these issues and provided solutions, I will be looking to change to another platform where the aforementioned functionality already exists and you will lose my business. In the meantime, I will also continue to use X (Twitter) to keep others aware of the lack of progress and the disregard that Xero has for its existing customers. As a courtesy to other Xero clients I will also be copying this thread to the Xero central.

I look forward to receiving your further and more positive feedback in due course.

Sincerely,

Graham Tottle",0
So disappointing. The initial request for this is well over ten years old. We had to create a work around for this more than five years ago. You'll just have to understand that most of us have no faith that multiple addresses will ever come to fruition.,0

Copy and paste, copy and paste...every single line six different times only to find out the address I just removed is the very next address I need. And the information on invoice A shouldn't be changing every time someone has to change the shipping address for a different invoice to the same billing address!  OMG.  So I have to go back and change the information AGAIN just to resend a copy of the A invoice because the customer lost it. And I am not even in accounting! I just close out drop shipments and send the customer a copy of the paid invoice! PLEASE FIX THIS!

"Chariel Kines - How we got around this was including the address as a LINE ITEM with the Shipping.  Example: UPS Ground:  ABC Company, 123 Main Street, Anywhere, NY

This helped it retain on the invoice incase we had to resend.  It was an easy fix since the ""Ship To"" box was not included on the invoice template anyway, we removed it from our custom template so it only shows the Bill To on the top of the invoice.

Hope this is helpful to you.",1

"I do not believe that a company that is advertising on mainstream TV in the UK to use their software consider this BASIC function as ""complex""!!!!!!!!!!

And what idiot would use the ""add delivery address"" function on new invoicing if it updates all other existing invoices for that contact to that new address!!!!!

What elicit drugs were they on when they thought that was a good idea!!!!

In the UK, Tax Invoice records have to be held for 7 years. I'm sure it would be illegal for any details to change on any Tax records once submitted to the HMRC & Companies House. Plus, how would you be able to track where any goods/products were previously shipped?

"I have recently been in direct e-mail contact with Kelly regarding this issue. Here is my latest reply to her:

Kelly,

Thank you for your reply. I will indeed reserve judgement as I believe actions speak louder than words. However, my expectations are low given that there has been no progress for such a long time. Furthermore, I have written to you several times over the last three years through Xero Central without getting replies or progress on subjects that are critical for a large number of your clients. After I wrote about the situation on X (Twitter), I was contacted by telephone by one of your colleagues who said he would follow up, but he never did, so I'm sure you will appreciate my continued cynicism. There has been no progress or any updates regarding multiple delivery address for months if not years. Nor has there been an update regarding the removal of the available stock figure in the quantity field in new invoicing. 
For a large company professing to be a market leader along with Quickbooks, Sage etc this lack of communication is both unprofessional and insulting to your clients. Xero has been ""working on it"" for too long - exactly how many programmers are working on these issues? I simply fail to believe that it can be that difficult (if there is a will to do it) and that it should take this long - particularly as multiple delivery addresses are already available in Purchase Orders and available stock is shown in the quantity fields of both Quotations and Credit notes - presumably these features integrate across all of Xero's applications, so why are they not included in new invoicing? Given the aforementioned, the fact that Xero are delaying their deployment within new invoicing leads me to the conclusion that they are both possible but are being lined up as chargeable extras in the future - not something that will be welcomed, I'm sure.
I will therefore continue to make people aware of these issues on X (Twitter) as a matter of public service, until at least these two issues have been satisfactorily resolved.

Sincerely,

Graham Tottle ",1
+1 to Graham's post. Had a similar experience interacting with Xero on X. Continue to bring it up there until they get this fixed. I have been with Xero for 12 years now. In year 1 I expected this to get fixed in the next year or two. It's insane how long it has taken while silly projects like the Apple Watch app were developed.,1
"I'm on a trial run to see if Xero can replace my use of QB.  I was surprised that this feature isn't there...I ship to big distributors (Anixter, Wesco) who have locations all around the USA, but one billing address.  I guess the only way to do this is to create the same customer multiple times with the different shipping addresses.  Seems like a waste of time and maybe an accounting nightmare to send multiple overdue invoices.  

I would also need the billing and shipping addresses listed on the invoice I send to the customer so they know where product was shipped.  James' post is concerning, that this was requested 12 years ago and it still hasent happened, so I guess it wont and I need to see if this is a deal killer to move forwarrd with Xero.",1
"@Dale Bourgeois

During your trial, consider if the following are important to you versus what might be available in other packages:
- Multiple addresses for a single customer:-::: no progress from Xero
- Activity statements with aging periods for customers (i.e. 30, 60, 90 days outstanding etc):-::: no progress or interest from Xero
- Invoicing:-:::Xero has implemented a new invoicing architecture that has caused our workflow to take additional time.  
- Pricing:
-	Basic package with 1 person payroll is 2 x more expensive than no payroll
-	Comprehensive package with 5 person payroll is  2.57 x more expensive than no payroll.  
-	Key point is that if you have a payroll of 2 to 3 people and multiple business interests, then from our perspective Xero is more expensive than other options.
-	Of the 10 businesses we run through Xero, the subscription plans are:
•	4 x Comprehensive
•	4 x Ultimate 10
•	1 x Ultimate 50
•	1 x Ultimate 100
We would overlook the subscription price if the first several points were addressed.   For some of our businesses, it doesn’t matter. Still, the high-volume, transaction-based businesses with account customers and multiple addresses do matter, and Xero’s limitations are causing a lag in some areas of our account management and our end customer satisfaction.  The real cost of Xero is in the additional hours we spend dealing with customers who are questioning basic information that should be automatic from Xero.
While integrations are helpful for Xero to offer greater features and not have to manage them, the additional costs required are questionable.
Our accountant thinks Xero is great, and it functions well from a compliance standpoint.  Operationally, we are reviewing alternatives.
Review Xero, and make sure it meets your minimum requirements.  Don’t expect things to change if they have been ignored and/or patronised for so long.  A short trial may not give you exposure to some of the items that are important to you.
Good luck Dale.

"Some really good points here from @SamBond...
I would strongly recommend using the xero api to address these needs.
It is relatively straight forward now to create web pages that interact with the Xero api (which is well documented) and design pages to do just the type of thing you are describing.
It is not ideal and you would expect a competent accounts package to offer the features you are describing.

I run a complete subscription and renewal package via an api web interface, the subscription and subscriber data is stored in a separate database and it links to invoices and quotes raised in xero, I am slowly expanding it to include account interactions like sending reminders and accepting quotes and purchase orders.  

This leaves xero to handle the transactions and manage the financial accounts - rather than let it get too close to my business.

In the attached screenshot of my online subscription business I can see overdue invoices, expiring subscriptions and subscriber status in one shot with all the payment, quotes and invoicing data linked to xero and new quotes are automatically generated in xero when required.",3
"I switched from Sage to Xero because I find Xero more straightforward and user-friendly. However, Sage offers more features, like the ability to assign multiple shipping addresses to a single contact. This is important for me because I have clients with multiple branches, and my driver often gets confused about the correct delivery address. I currently have to handwrite the address on the delivery slip, which is time-consuming.",3

I Have been weighting since 2019 for this functionality!!! still nothing. we have this functionality in purchase orders so how hard can it be.  i am exploring new software that has this function.  i cant wait for ever for Xero to sharpen up and bring out this feature!!,0
"At present we do not use Xero's invoicing function for customers because it does not seem to be possible to store multiple delivery addresses for individual customers.  In our business, where much of what we sell goes 'under bond' to a warehouse, most customers have at least two delivery addresses.  And some, who for example send wine out as Christmas presents, have many different delivery addresses against their account.",1
An idea that has 1100 votes and was posted 2 years ago. it takes this long to implement this?,1

"I transitioned from Sage to Xero a few years ago, largely because Xero was ahead of the curve in many areas. However, the lack of support for multiple addresses under a single contact record has been a significant pain point for my business. Sage handled this feature very well, and it’s disappointing that Xero doesn’t yet offer a comparable solution. 

For example, we work with a client that requires individual invoices for numerous delivery sites. Currently, having to place the delivery address in the reference field is cumbersome and unprofessional. This feels like a fundamental feature that should already be in place.  

I understand the complexity of implementing such a solution, but it’s vital for businesses like mine. While this enhancement might not bring immediate revenue, it will undoubtedly help retain your loyal customers and improve user satisfaction.

"Sorry it's all platitudes as we've been waiting about 5 years for one simple idea to be implemented (but we need about 15 things - including this issue to be actually dealt with rather than just commented on that they ""are looking at it"").

Please do not waste your time and energy on Xero - unless you have a very simple business with single customers and simple sales, Xero is not up to it in any form.

We have started moving all 3 of our businesses over (all over £1m t/o) to QB as they offer the right balance. Yes there's a few niggles - but not basic ones like Xero.

If they stopped creating such stupid ads and stopped being Aus/NZ centric in their development processes, maybe they'd take their customers in Europe a bit more seriously.

Bye bye Xero I won't miss you.",0
"Newer user here, came over from QB.  I’ve already been creating multiple “customers” for my larger distributors, Anixter, Wesco, Graybar …. They also ask me to drop ship to THEIR customers.  So now I Temporarily change the shipping address but have no way to remove “Anixter” from the ship too address.  So the ship too looks something like “Anixter - Company X” then the temp address for my packing slips.  

Shipping to all the different branch locations of a single customer or drop shipping to THEIR customers was so simple in QB.  There’s so much I like about Xero but this may be a deal killer for me",1

Having multiple shipping addresses in address 'books' for each customer is not an unusual request for any business selling physical products. Not having this facility requires us to enter the shipping address again for a customer with multiple sites whenever they make an new order unless it is to be sent to the site that they last ordered for. There is also potential for order mistakes if we do not change the delivery address. Some of our customers make a batch of duplicate  orders for several sites which is a lot more difficult with the current set up.,2
"Interesting that this is considered a product idea when in fact the delivery address process is ""BROKEN"".

For example...I updated the address today, and ALL PREVIOUS addresses are updated.  Customers with links to their invoices now all have incorrect addresses.

Please explain how this isn't a priority, as it's ""broken""
Does this actually breach confidentiality of the delivery customer?????

It is extremely difficult to know where our products (pools) were delivered for warranty purposes.  

NOT GOOD ENOUGH :-(",0
Commenting on Jenny's incident: Even the fact that one can accidentally alter historical records like invoices is a joke for an accounting system. A past and issued invoice for a closed and reconciled transaction should NEVER change just because an address for a customer has been updated. Finalized accounting records should be immutable.,1
Also in regards to Jenny's comment.... I can't believe updating an address will change past invoices?? That's insane!  The software does so much so well but that's just accounting 101!  You can't allow the software to change past invoices.,1
"Are there any third party apps that can be used as a work around for this, or do all contact details default to the details held in Xero? 
This issue is the main reason we are not moving from Sage50 to Xero which is so frustrating as Xero will provide efficiencies in many other areas!",2
"Anyone aware of software other than Quickbooks that can handle this address issue?  It's difficult enough to deal with having to create multiple accounts for the same customer with many different branches, but I didnt realize when I change that branches deliver too address for a drop shipment for them, it will change all of my old invoices to that new address.  That's just plain rediculous in the accounting world.

@Kelly Munro - is there any further update or ETA for the multiple addresses functionality?  It appears to have been 9 months since the last update.  Thx.,2

Please confirm when we can expect this important update on a single contact with multiple delivery addresses. This is a a basic and having to enter the address manually defeats the objective of the automation and time saving aspect xero promotes. ",2
@Kelly Munro is there any update on this?  I just read through the new invoicing features being released and this is nowhere to be found.,1

Just wondering if there is an update on the roll out of multiple delivery addresses for one Contact? Thank you 🙏 ",3
"Will this be added to the New Invoicing being rolled out in March 2025? We have the onerous task of saving the packing slip as a PDF then having to edit the PDF to change the delivery address to suit for customers who have multiple delivery address - the only other work around for this is to create multiple Customer Contacts with the same name but adding in brackets the suburb or street address, however this gets problematic for our clients who then receive multiple statements for their account and only want one consolidated statement!

",2
"I cannot believe this has not happened yet. No wonder I see Xero is increasing their advertising budget, but they forget this critical feature. ",1
This would be very helpful because if I work with a contractor I want to keep track how much he owes me even if it distributed with multiple addresses. Here is a example of how we do this is on our scheduling system.,3
that is a good thing. For my company i deal with builders that have multiple locations .  so that would be very helpful for me.   they know what invoice goes to what location.,3
"Hey Kelly, thank you for the updates. We appreciate you!

Is there a quarter on your roadmap for when this feature has been allocated to?

This really needs to be implemented. You have drop down boxes for everything else - surely it can't be that hard to add them for customer addresses. We have just moved across to Xero and are really starting to regret it with the limitations we are finding.,2
"Hi Kelly
It is a year since you commented on this request.   As you have not updated us, I take it that there has been no progression.
WHY.  This request is a BASIC FUNCTION of any decent accounting package and really should be ADDED before XERO makes any further PRICE HIKES",1
"It is a joke that accounting software, marketed as a game changer for business, lacks such a basic function - we moved to Xero about two months ago, we're preparing to migrate back over to Sage. There are far too many issues with Xero that are simply ignored by their developers.",1
I am about to migrate to MYOB because of this and their inventory system is much better. Plus its alot cheaper!! Adios amigos :-),0
As this request has been ignored for over 12 Years i will look into migrating to MYOB as well. Xero can do multiple addresses for purchase orders !!!! but  not invoices??? 12 years is a long time to wait!!! for a simple request!!!,0
"We have multiple client enquiries on getting their bookkeeping software but this is a real blocker for some of them. Shipping addresses need to be recorded permanently so when you look up an invoice again it says which customer location it was sent to or which office was visited.

"We're currently looking at switching to Zoho for subscription invoicing and CRM. It offers more features than Xero in this space and comes at a much lower cost compared to HubSpot, which we currently use for CRM but doesn't handle subscription invoicing to our requirements.

"I have quite a few customers that we deliver to multiple addresses and really need this ASAP!!!
If you can't get this up and running then why not let us manually update the delivery address in the invoice as a temporary fix.

"Hi Kelly, It has now been a year since this update - where is this solution at now? We are looking at moving from MYOB but this is CRITICAL to our operations and there doesn't seem to be any work around available while we are waiting for the software update.

Bill one contact but select a second to deliver to?",1
"Hi Kelly,

Our company has just moved over from Quickbooks Online as it was so limited, and I'm a little disappointed to see how limited Xero is with this feature.

We work with retailers such as Home Hardware and Ace Hardware, which have a vast amount of stores, but are billed centrally through their head office. Not being able to add different delivery addresses or even manually change address every time (as we had to do with QuickBooks) is slowing down our order processing process and is essential for us.

Please update us as soon as possible.",2
@Melissa Johns I use non tracking products as a work around until multiple delivery addresses are available :-),2
"@MarkSmith can you please explain how this works? 
",2
@Anya Pagden using a non tracking product will make the shipping address show up on the invoice and packing slip and as it's not tracking it wont affect your inventory. All you need to do is use a logical number system for the part number. e.g. DEL-XYZL01-001. The 2nd and 3 part of the part number relate to the customer account reference and address sequence. if you have 10 delivery addresses it would go all the way upto 010.,2
This is highest rated product idea on Xero.  Please provide an update on when this feature will be rolled out. This is the only thing stopping us from moving away from Sage50.,1
"This is the one reason we might have to leave Xero. many of our customers are large organisations where we deliver services for multiple departments and individuals, but we certainly don't want to create a different version of that customer for each contact.",1
I have been waiting for this upgrade for 5 years i have seen other comments that have been waiting for up to 12 years.  Kelly Munro just keep on repeating every few months / years it is very complicated.  xero has the ability to have multiple delivery address for purchase orders so why not invoices???  so how hard can it be???  i am now fully convinced after 5 years of waiting Xero have no intension of introducing this feature.  i am now actively looking for a new accounting package that supports this feature. 1222 users want this feature still not enough for Xero to fund this upgrade!!,1
"I gave up some time a few years (around 8 or 9 from memory) ago (on Xero request, and I am sure I wouldn't have been the only participant) to provide customer/user input on this requirement (and other proposals) - at the time the immediate feedback I received that it was likely to take around a year but was important and would happen. I have requested updates from the development team contact I had at the time, but after 3 years, they stopped responding. Incidentally, the updates that I did receive were that it was coming soon!

Overall, Xero is an excellent fit for our requirements, but this remains a disappointment in terms of delivery, communication, and commitment.

This is ridiculous flannel. This has been a top user request for many years. There is no reason it should take this long....it's not hard to do.,0
It's not just being able to add the multiple addresses - it's having them STAY on the invoice - so when you look at a past invoice it clearly says WHO you sent it to.

We often need to send invoices and statements to multiple contacts within the same organisation, especially when different departments are responsible for different projects.

Each contact should only receive reminders and statements relevant to their department or project—NOT for the whole organisation.

Company Pty Ltd
Company Pty. Ltd.
Company. Pty. Ltd.

Xero always said they listen to users, but for so many years, this issue has not been resolved, i believe is because if they develop this feature, it will affect their vendor.

Meaning contact name is client's site project manager (usually the site manager names are different) and attention to is company's name. then i utilise the ""account code"" example ""ABC Company [Harbour Site]"" for future convenience.

and i default that branding theme from the contact for future convenience too.

Note: if later on bill to headquarter and SOA combine all project site then when create sales invoice, we will change the contact to finance contact.

But if client prefer SOA by project site, then we continue to use contact as per quotation for sales invoice.

Any update on this????,1
"This will be massively overdue. It is THE biggest frustration of mine and causes so much manual entry. The answer is simple:
1. Master address set - stays the same until you change it
2. Delivery address - Never stores - and is asked for every time
3. Historic invoices must show where they were shipped to for historic reasons - so must be written onto the invoice

Simple as that.",1
Why even have a 'Delivery Address' field if it can't be unique to an invoice? It's just stupid beyond belief!,1
"Totally agree, massively overdue.

I would add further to the below comment, it would be great if an option of a drop down box could be added for delivery addresses, linked to each invoice address. As soon as you enter the invoice address, the drop down box appears, should allow you to add additional / remove addresses as and when required, thus building a stored database to select from. I would suggest the drop down selection would just need to show first line of address and postcode.

Makes it a simple process all around........

Would also be EXTREMELY beneficial to have the ability to run reports based on delivery address, to allow full sales analysis. We have a number of different sites we deliver to under one entity address, trying to analyse the sales for each site to ascertain gains / losses is nigh on impossible..... or a very manual process......",1
Great Idea,4
@Richard Fishenden - I was curious about your 3rd point in your 3 key considerations and wondered if you could elaborate further on this please why you specifically mention 'Historic Invoices'? Thanks.,2
Utterly shameful that Xero can't figure out how to allow multiple shipping addresses to contacts.,0
"Campbell Green - what I mean is that once I have written in the delivery address to an invoice - when I look at it in a years time (historically) - it still shows that delivery address. At the moment, if I update a delivery address it overwrites every single invoice for that client with the new address which is terrible! I have made several shipping errors because of this. It's such a simple change - and logic seems to have missed the intelligent people making it.",1
"Thinking about it - perhaps the answer is that Delivery Address is either:

1. Not even an option on the account - so no field - invoice specific
2. Has a tick box 'Remember Delivery Address'
3. or it would seem some need multiple sites - so ability to tick the box and add say 7 sites

"Let's be honest the whole handling of addresses full stop is ridiculous! If you change any of the contact details, be it delivery or standard address it should not apply the changes to previously raised invoices! This is a major audit issues.

However, the seemingly undending emails, the explanations of the importance, and the near silence Xero has become more than I can bear. It is not clear to me how to remove myself from this idea so that I stop getting all this spam in my inbox. I hope that's not another item for Xero's development plan.",0
"Greg - click on your settings (top right of the screen) and there are tick boxes on there re updates and new comments. As you say - get spammed with emails every day and nothing happened on the ""ideas"" for years ",0
"Building on this request, it would also be extremely helpful to have the ability to choose which linked person under a single business contact is used when creating quotes or invoices. Many businesses work with multiple individuals at the same company, and being able to select the correct person (rather than defaulting to the primary contact) would greatly improve accuracy and tracking.",4
"Thanks for the update Kelly, this is a step in the right direction. The new fields in the contact record are easy to find.",3
