1. One of my customers requires this.
2. One of my customer is looking at integrating Xero (used by one of their legal entities) and a major ERP. UoM is the missing field.

My recommendation:
1. Add a System Administration tab (This could be leveraged for future updates)
2. Create a simple table called Unit of Meassure (free text would suffice and one field for the actual unit). This is enough for version 1
3. Another table with Inter UoM conversion (only UoM created in the first table allowed)
4. Another table with Intra UoM conversion (only UoM created in the first table allowed)

This is simple and enough for now. It is also future proof as this design is not contradictory with introducing updates such as the ability to define Inter/Intra conversion for specific Items at a later stage.

I implement large ERP systems and I would be happy to collaborate on the design of this and other features. 

For your consideration.

For example, you might purchase 1 whole box of something containing say 10 units, but sell the units in the contained units. For example, I buy plastic filament by the roll, containing a qty of N Kg, but when its placed on a customer invoice or quote, the qty is in grams.  I buy by the Kg, and Sell by the gram.  But others might buy ONE box of screws containing 100 of them, The purchase price is $$ PER BOX.  I currently enter in the sale quantity, and divide the purchase price by the number of units, but, due to mathematical precision of only 3 decimal places, the price calculates incorrectly, and I have to adjust it later.
So, the suggestion is to make Billing or ""Buy Now"" transactions with two quantity columns, one being the quantity purchased (linked directly / to the exactly purchase price), and the second column being the qty available for sale, and this is what is tracked in Inventory.

You've gotta ask how you measure a unit at the start and for stocktake.

When I get units in, it is in mm, so when it starts, I change a setting from Units of Unit to mm increments, from there I say how many mm I acquire and then between here and stocktake, this is the data that is required for reporting purposes.

When assessing how to track this, ideally you need to know how to accommodate it, and when you know the item and you know the unit, you can see ""Units sold"" and it's 50 units is equal to 50mm based on the Original setting for that item versus say a physical item of a filter which 50 units would be a Unit qty of 50 of these.

Either way, it's 50 and 50, 50 qty of either, but 50 in a different metric of units from Unit to metric milimetres.

I support this feature and unfortunately this will be the achilies heel for my business operations which run on exactly the metric measurement which is difficult to implement without paying $200.00 per month which would wipe out all profits unfortunately.

However, there is a noticeable gap in Xero’s current inventory and purchasing workflow that impacts internal controls and cost accuracy.

At present, there is no mechanism in Xero that ensures the Storekeeper or Receiver is clearly informed about what exactly is expected to be received as per the Purchase Order. This creates a control issue—the receiving personnel may not have visibility over item descriptions, quantities, or agreed pricing, leaving room for errors, mismatches, or even misuse.

Further compounding the issue is the lack of clarity and integration around units of measure (UOM). An item’s cost can vary significantly based on the UOM used (e.g., carton, box, unit), and if this is not clearly defined in the Purchase Order and matched at the time of receipt, the price comparison and procurement approval process becomes ineffective. This not only undermines cost control but can also lead to accounting discrepancies.",approved,2

Currently, we have to manually include the UOM in the item description, which:
- Reduces clarity and consistency across invoices
- Makes reporting and inventory tracking more difficult
- Increases the risk of human error

Suggested Implementation:
- Add a dedicated UOM field in the Products and Services setup
- Display the UOM column in invoices, quotes, and bills
- Allow customization of UOMs (e.g., kg, m², pcs, hrs) per item

This is particularly necessary for any sort of clearing account (or bucket account) which by its very nature should be balanced back to zero on a regular basis, however within Xero this is not possible. There is a clunky and time consuming  work around that it is done in a spreadsheet, and stored in files, and downloaded updated and uploaded  regularly.

She recorded me talking about the importance of this product feature request, and how people are manually doing it now. This was passed to the product team, who met with me Sep 15 ( the day after Dana from Xero posted her response).
 
I had a long conversation with the Xero product team about the importance of being able to mark off all transactions, particularly in clearing accounts. They asked me lots of questions, and I feel I left the meeting with them understanding the importance of the issue.

And the more complex these are the more difficult and time wasting it is to do using Excel. Unfortunately I think alot of Accountants have never experienced the ease and efficiency of being able to reconcile within the software, so don't know what they are missing, and it's why this product request is not at the top of the list.

With STP now the ATO are on late super straight away - dots are connected so even if people are a few days late with their super it could get quite costly with fines and charges. The Auto Super if a super fund bounces is sooooooo fraught with danger - it just bounces back in to the bank with no real clear notification that it has done so - shocking. In the bank it's far too easily mis allocated. I had a client reconcile it as Sales only to pick it up a year or so later when we started doing it, actually couldn't even find it in the end. That whole superannuation reconciliation process really needs to be improved, automated - it's all manual now and very very work around and potentially costly - Hope Xero have a review team working on this. Happy to be a part of as we really need this, not just for efficiencies and checks and balances - we need to be on this straight away.

I am currently working on creating a Xero application which will assist in managing balance sheet reconciliations. We plan on making the management process simple, essentially where you can add a ""reconciliation"" balance to each account for each month, and the system will notify you if this balance matches the current Xero balance. You will be able to add attachments and descriptions to each balance you enter. Each account can be approved by a specified person if required, by a specific date. The program will also tell you if the periods are locked, and if any old balances have changed, in order to maintain up to date reconciliations. 
You will be able to roll forward past reconciliations to make the current month easier as well, and view the 'last reconciled' rec available in the system.


Our initial plans don't include reconciling line by line transactions within the system (ie netting off lines as you go), however this may be something that we can add further down the line.

Would love to hear your feedback on this idea, and whether you would deem this to be useful in the current state

The functionality as you have explained it does not sound like what I am chasing here.  I am wanting to be able to tick off, line by line, in many cases in order to reconcile back to $0 so reconciling to a specific balance won't work in these sorts of cases.  eg.  Merchant clearing account, reconciles to $0 but usually has an ""unticked"" balance at a specific date that won't come in till a day later.  

Also, personally I believe that this is a critical element for any decent accounting software and am astounded that Xero has not seen this yet, so your solution SHOULD be short lived if Xero listen to their partners and users and see the relevance and importance of this functionality being in the core software.

Unfortunately what you are describing at this stage doesn't sound like the solution I am looking for. The key need is to be able to tick and clear the bits and pieces that reconcile ( often this is to $0.00) and to be left with only the items that are waiting to be reconciled. For many Balance Sheet Accounts this can be complex and transactions that tick off against each other can be months apart. They can also be six transactions on one side that tick off against one or two transactions on the other side.

The hard bit is working out why it doesn't reconcile. Having some way of noting that you have identified a transaction, which remains on the record when you return would be really helpful.

Also, I am not sure @Dana A has understood the issue as they are referring to reconciling balances within a company. The majority of reconciliations are with 3rd parties (e.g. HMRC, Bank loans, Intercompany loans) so the information being compared is outside of Xero. A good first step would simply be the ability to tick off transactions and for the tick to remain (unless removed). A formal reconciliation system, similar to the bank rec system, could follow in due course, though I am not sure it needs to be that sophisticated.",approved,2

As I mentioned, the core functionality of the application will be to manage the completion and approval of balance sheet reconciliations, as there is no current process for this within Xero, and is required from a governance perspective.
 
I will be pushing to have line by line reconciliations added to the functionality of this application, but although currently untested, I do foresee some major roadblocks here due to the API functionality within Xero, specifically within the parameters running the journal API, (eg in order to pull out the transactions for a month per GL account, it appears that you need to run a data dump of every single journal ever posted. This would cause a timeout for many businesses.)

I will periodically post updates on this thread in regards to how we are tracking on this solution.

I understand that this is a feature that a lot of us ask for, but I would be remiss to not add a note of caution.

My experience in small business environments in Africa, is that charging interest is often more effort than it is worth, and can run afoul of legislation and regulation very quickly is you are not careful.

Why more effort than worth? More often than not, when a client does pay, they are going to beg and plea for you to write back the interest....especially under current economic conditions.

Why legislation and regulation?
1. If you do not have an agreement with the client stating that you may charge interest, you could very well be in breach of law if you do charge interest, and
2. Most southern African countries have Usury Legislation that specificy maximum interest rates, and requirements to change the rate every-time that official interest rates change. If you fail to do so, you would be in breach of law.

I think that all your customers appreciate that you are upgrading your sales technology however, if we can't collect the payment for the sale from our customer, there should be a way for us to charge them the interest that is due according to our terms of trade.

I applaud your enterprise in offering something that Xero seems incapable of providing. 

I think however, that you have missed the entire point of this discussion. Every single contributor to this idea expects the ability to charge interest to be an integral part of Xero. We pay more that enough for this accounting package, and it should not be an added expense, especially in this economic climate.

While I find Xero easier to use, MYOB had a lot more functionality. And after using MYOB for a short time got used to it and was easy for me to use.

The two main things that I have requested from Xero, are that they enable the system to change an invoice that was approved in error to a draft. Having this feature would also make it possible to add interest manually calculated to the invoice. This would at least be a step in the right direction.

As with MYOB, the system should have the capability to automatically calculate the interest owing based on the terms inputted into the client card.

One was a date field where you put the cut-off date for which you wanted to calculate the charge - ie if today was 1st August, Id charge for any invoice 30 days or more overdue so I would choose the date 30/06/2023. Then in the comment field, Id write ""Service charge for invoices overdue >30 days"". It would have a GL code there which you could set up and then it stayed the same. The system would create a service charge for each client by totalling all invoices with due dates before the date I entered and charging 1.5% of the amount. Then it would generate an invoice form we had created and send it. 
When the customer receives an invoice at the start of the new month, it was a reminder that being overdue was costing them money too. I would credit any charge where the client paid the overdue invoice within 7 days of the start of the month. 
It completely changed the behaviour of 90% of my clients.

Hi everyone,

I noticed this feature request and wanted to share a tool that could help:  https://stagepay.app/late-fees

StagePay automates the process of applying late fees and interest to invoices, saving you time and ensuring nothing gets missed. Here’s how it tackles the issues mentioned:

Automatic application of late fees and interest—choose between flat fees, percentages, interest rates, or even multiple concurrent late fees and interest charges.

Handles part-paid invoices seamlessly by applying fees or interest only to the remaining unpaid portion.

Customisable notifications and reminders—you can set up automatic emails or messages to notify clients when fees or interest are applied, along with payment reminders.

Custom late fee and interest policies tailored to your business, so you’re always in control of how and when charges are applied.

No monthly subscription cost—StagePay only charges a small transaction fee when your clients make payments by credit card.

Everything happens seamlessly, with notifications sent to your clients as soon as a fee or interest is applied. No need to manually intervene or recreate invoices—it’s all automated and clear.

If this sounds like something that could help, check it out at https://stagepay.app/late-fees

Thanks

John",approved,2

I think this request has been a top-voted one for a number of years now and is fairly 'basic' functionality in terms of the end user (perhaps not so with development).

As an aside, the method we have been using to get around this feature not existing has been shown to have lost us nearly £3000 revenue in the last year due to our user error (where we have been 'bodging' invoices so Xero payments asks the customer for the correct part payment).

It's difficult to go back to customers where we have made a mistake on invoicing but notice it months later.

Could you please list your best practice for taking a 30% deposit, for example, on a £2500 invoice? We're looking for a way that is:

1. Foolproof
2. Doesn't lumber a customer with multiple invoices for a single purchase (customers use their invoices to insure their goods).

We sell high value jewellery and very few customers pay in one hit. Deposits vary by customer and the value of the item. We won't start manufacture until half of the invoice value has been paid.

Alternatively, can the community recommend any other accounts packages that does offer this functionality? It's our year-end soon so porting elsewhere would be timely if needed.

From there I do not force clients anymore and the few that is still on Xero, I do service. But if they complaint about certain features that is not on Xero, I do recommend them to the other software companies that offer accounting software, at most of the times at a cheaper price.

Hey Everyone,

I just thought I would jump in here and make you all aware of Stagepay. Stagepay addresses the issue of managing payment stages by allowing you to create them for your invoices. This way, customers can pay only for the specific stage that is due by card.

There is no subscription cost—just a small transaction fee on credit card payments. Stagepay is currently in Beta, and we would love your help in creating something awesome. If you're interested in using Stagepay to send your invoices, we'd be thrilled to have you onboard.

Stagepay is exclusive to Xero; we love Xero, and Stagepay works seamlessly with it to provide a user-friendly workflow for sending invoices.

Hope to hear from you all soon!

Capturing the true date a service is provided is essential for organizations delivering services across multiple days. Relying on the description field for this purpose, as Kelly Munroe suggested, compromises data integrity, reporting, and searchability, especially when sorting across varied client invoices. A static, filterable date field would streamline reporting, i.e., how much of a service item was provided between two specific dates, without using invoice dates as it will not capture correct information, especially when one invoices the following month for services made the previous month. It will also support consistency and significantly improve functionality for users who may depend on detailed service documentation. It’s easier to have the information in one software vs having multiple software databases.

I'll give you an example, you have departments for a tracking category. Cost of Sales, Research and Development, Sales, Marketing, Admin.

Then on the P&L you want all expenses for all accounts that have the Cost of Sales tracking category to show in Cost of Sales, then in Research and Development, you want all accounts to show for the research and development tracking category, Sales and Marketing, etc.

You then want to display all the accounts and amounts in each section.

Our business has several projects and its important the cost/income is posted to each project to review its sustainability.

The ability to replicate what your customer has done on their side when they reduce a payment against multiple invoices is fundamentally important to the client ledger reconciliation process...

The last several updates have added functionality around reporting that, to my mind is neither here nor there, while a basic and frequent accounting process step remains overly convoluted with no solution in sight after years on the request list!

Do Xero even have employees skilled enough to make this change? 

It seems quite obvious now that I've asked myself this question that the answer is no. 

They are only employing people to make things ""beautiful"" and creating endless tabs and reports no one will ever use,  then increase their prices from all their ""added features"" without offering the most BASIC of features like credit note find and match and manual GST adjustment to match suppliers billing.....

No help with xero on here. Endless time consuming tabs and new reports that you will need to customise and save to be able to use and downright ugly. I always forget where I have to go to add a credit note as it is not on the dashboard. If you were to only use enter bills and invoices I think Xero is capable for that. For anything beyond that, it is time consuming. They could make it very easy to use but they have over complicated things. Like why have so many amount boxes? EG entering a bill. 1. total 2.unit price 3. amount/total. if the total does not match up with the unit you have to manually figure out which one to adjust because the total does not adjust. also Reconciling batch payments is a nightmare.

And adding my 2 cents worth...

This is how Credit Notes are and always have been handled in the real world. Like a negative bill/invoice.

Instead of adding a whole seperate process of allocation, CR Notes are simply selected as one of the invoices/bills being paid, just with a negative balance.

Oh how I wish this was an option for handling CR Notes in Xero. You could ditch the whole CR Note API and just allow negative balances on invoices/bills. The only validation issue becomes preventing a numpty user from trying to generate a negative batch payment or receipt, which can use the same logic already used to prevent negative invoice/bills right now.

It is a far simpler and more practical methodology that aligns precisely with the real world process.",approved,1
